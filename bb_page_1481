Influenced by the English Civil War, Hobbes wrote that chaos or civil war &#8211; situations identified with a state of nature and the famous motto bellum omnium contra omnes (&#8221;the war of all against all&#8221;) &#8211; could only be averted by strong central government. He thus denied any right of rebellion toward the social contract. However, Hobbes did discuss the possible dissolution of the State. Since the social contract was made to institute a state that would provide for the &#8220;peace and defense&#8221; of the people, the contract would become void as soon as the government no longer protected its citizens. By virtue of this fact, man would automatically return to the state of nature until a new contract is made. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

The inarticulate and lonely citizens of Winesburg, each with his or her own secret tale to tell, frequently relate those tales to, or through their interactions with, the character of George Willard, a young Winesburg citizen on the cusp of manhood with dreams of becoming a writer. Thus Winesburg tells the story of the townspeople&#8217;s loneliness and alienation in parallel with the tale of George&#8217;s own coming of age. The citizens of Winesburg are described obliquely as &#8220;grotesques,&#8221; but as the introductory chapter makes clear, &#8220;The grotesques were not all horrible.

Originally published in June of 1848, it challenged the prevailing morals of the time; a critic went so far as to pronounce it &#8220;utterly unfit to be put into the hands of girls&#8221;.

He was responsible for formulating the Poincar&#233; conjecture, one of the most famous problems in mathematics. In his research on the three-body problem, Poincar&#233; became the first person to discover a chaotic deterministic system which laid the foundations of modern chaos theory. He is considered to be one of the founders of the field of topology. Poincar&#233; introduced the modern principle of relativity and was the first to present the Lorentz transformations in their modern symmetrical form. He discovered the remaining relativistic velocity transformations and recorded them in a letter to Lorentz in 1905. Thus he obtained perfect invariance of all of Maxwell&#8217;s equations, the final step in the formulation of the theory of special relativity.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
