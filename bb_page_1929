It is a mystery indeed; the serial novel was just half completed at the time of Dickens&#8217; death &#8211; leading to much speculation how it might have ended.\nThe novel is named after Edwin Drood, one of the characters, but it mostly tells the story of his uncle, a choirmaster named John Jasper, who is in love with his pupil, Rosa Bud. Miss Bud is Drood&#8217;s fianc&#233;e, and has also caught the eye of the high-spirited and hot-tempered Neville Landless! Landless comes from Ceylon with his twin sister, Helena. Neville Landless and Edwin Drood take a dislike to one another the moment they meet.\nThe story is set in Cloisterham, a lightly fictionalised Rochester (in Kent, England). Rochester is close to Dicken&#8217;s country house Gad&#8217;s Hill Place, where the final chapter was written and where Dickens died.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

He published hundreds of monographs, textbooks and interpretive studies in both history and political science. He graduated from DePauw University in 1898, where he met and eventually married Mary Ritter Beard, one of the founders of the first Greek-letter society for women, Kappa Alpha Theta. Many of his books were written in collaboration with his wife, whose own interests lay in feminism and the labor union movement (Woman as a Force in History, 1946).\n\nIn 1921, Charles and Mary Beard published their History of the United States. A contemporaneous review stated: &#8220;The authors&#8230; assume enough maturity in high school students to justify a topical rather than a chronological treatment. They have dealt with movements, have sketched large backgrounds, have traced causes, and have discussed the interrelation of social and economic forces and politics.

The story: the heroine, Margaret Hale, is the daughter of a Nonconformist minister who moves to the fictional industrial town of Milton after leaving the Church of England. The town is modeled after Manchester, where Gaskell lived as the wife of a Unitarian minister.\n\nThe change of lifestyle shocks Margaret, who sympathizes deeply with the poverty of the workers and comes into conflict with John Thornton, the owner of a local mill, also a friend of her father. After an encounter with a group of strikers, in which Margaret attempts to protect Thornton from the violence, he proposes to her, telling her that he is in love with her; she rejects his proposal of marriage, mainly because she sees it as if it were out of obligation for what she had done. Later, he sees her with her fugitive brother, whom he mistakes for another suitor, and this creates further unresolved conflict. Margaret, once she believes she has lost his affection, begins to see him in another light, and eventually they are reunited.\n\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

And when I say &#8216;lives,&#8217; I do not mean exists, nor &#8216;muddles through.&#8217;&#8221;\n\nArnold Bennett knew a &#8220;rat race&#8221; when he saw one. Every day, his fellow white-collar Londoners followed the same old routine. And they routinely decried the sameness in their lives.\n\nSo Bennett set out to explain how to inject new enthusiasm into living. In this delightful little work, he taught his fellow sufferers how to set time apart for improving their lives. Yes, he assured them, it could be done. Yes, if you want to feel connected with the world, instead of endlessly pacing the treadmill (or, &#8220;exceeding your programme&#8221;, as he called it), you must do so.\n\nFor time, as he gleefully notes, is the ultimate democracy. Each of us starts our day with 24 hours to spend. Even a saint gets not a minute more; even the most inveterate time-waster is docked not a second for his wastrel ways. And he can choose today to turn over a new leaf!\n\nBennett believed that learning to discern cause and effect in the world would give his readers an endless source of enjoyment and satisfaction. Instead of only being able to discuss what they had heard, they could graduate to what they thought&#8230; and lift themselves completely from the deadening influence of a day at the office.\n\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

They were popular best-sellers at the time they were published and the original editions are still readily available in used book shops. The novels gave their name to a fictional genre called Graustarkian: this genre contains tales of romance and intrigue usually featuring titled characters in small, fictional, Central European countries.\n\nDuring the 1870&#8217;s, Graustark&#8217;s ruler, Prince Ganlook, was killed in a war with neighboring Axphain. As part of the ensuing peace treaty, Graustark agreed to pay a large indemnity to Axphain, to be due, with interest, in fifteen years.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
