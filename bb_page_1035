{"ldata":[{"name":"z Art and Heart Audiobook","id":96822,"description":"Art and Heart by Ella Wheeler Wilcox (1850-1919) (Poetry)\n\nThis special poetry collection was assembled to celebrate the first anniversary of the creation of LibriVox. LibriVox volunteers bring you 38 different recordings of Art and Heart, by Ella Wheeler Wilcox. This poem, originally suggested by Betsie Bush, was chosen for this special collection due to a general concensus that the message of the poem corresponds with the spirit of LibriVox.\n\nThe poem asserts that, &#8220;It is not art, but heart, that wins the wide world over.&#8221; And so it is with LibriVox: it is not only the books, the poetry, the literature that make LibriVox what it is; but it is also the people, the diversity of voices, and all of the different lives and experiences that affect the way a person reads a piece of text. The art is the foundation of LibriVox, but the many hearts behind it are the true essence and spirit of LibriVox.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Hoffmann, a Frankfurt physician, wanted to buy a picture book for his son for Christmas in 1844. Not impressed by what the stores had to offer, he instead bought a notebook and wrote his own stories and pictures. While Struwwelpeter is somewhat notorious for its perceived brutal treatment of the erring children, it has been influential on many later children&#8217;s books, most notably Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.The source of the audio content is in the public domain.

Memorial Day was conceived as a time to remember military men and women who had lost their lives in war. Kings and presidents come and go and some of the reasons that wars have come about are now lost from memory or are obscured in our history texts.\n\nA consistent aspect of war is that those who fight them are not those who arrange them. The soldiers and sailors who suffer loss of limb, scarred minds or forfeit their lives mostly come from the lower and middle rungs of our societal ladder. They are our sons and daughters, husbands and wives, fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters.\n\nOnce gone, it is the family who notices the empty chair at the family table while society at large knows not their name. Death has captured them and taken them forever from our midst. It has become personal and not a vague philosophical idea. The theme of Donne&#8217;s poem is that, though Death is irresistible, it has no cause to be proud. The human spirit and its hope for redemption is indomitable. This was the weekly poetry project for the week of May 27th, 2006.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

He was influenced by Algernon Swinburne, who wrote the line &#8220;Time and the Gods are at strife&#8221; in his 1866 poem &#8220;Hymn to Proserpine&#8221;, as well as by the fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm and Hans Christian Andersen. In turn, Dunsany&#8217;s influence was felt by H. P. Lovecraft and Ursula K. Le Guin. Arthur C. Clarke corresponded with Dunsany between 1944 and 1956. Those letters are collected in the book Arthur C. Clarke &amp; Lord Dunsany: A Correspondence. Time and the Gods, a series of short stories written in a myth-like style, was first published in 1906.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
