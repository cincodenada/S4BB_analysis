Many of the rhymes&#8217; origins even at the time of this book&#8217;s writing could be traced back decades or centuries. L. Frank Baum in 1897, while living in Chicago, collected the rhymes and created short stories around them which add context and understanding for children who are drawn to the familiar melodies.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
