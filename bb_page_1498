In the summer of 1912, Vincent&#8217;s sister, Norma, found work as a waitress at a hotel near where they lived. One night, Norma insisted that Vincent attend a masquerade ball, given at the hotel, if only to get Vincent out of the house and to meet people. Vincent finally gave in, and while there, sang songs and recited &#8220;Renascence,&#8221; the first poem in this collection. This immediately won over the support of one &#8220;Miss Dow,&#8221; who would help Vincent raise enough money to attend Vassar College.

Political ambitions and the business of making money go hand in hand. A Senate seat suddenly opens up due to the current junior senator&#8217;s unexpected death, and the political machinations to fill the seat begin. Senatorial candidate John Harrington is a young idealist who thinks that fighting for truth and justice, regardless of political affiliation, is the way. But he is told he can&#8217;t possibly win because he isn&#8217;t partisan enough. His opponents in the iron mine, railroad and shipping business sabotage his first bid for office, because he wants to do away with protectionism in trade to open up global competition. He eventually succeeds in winning a Senate seat. He gives a rousing speech to Congress as they gather to elect a President in a race which has ended in a three way tie. His message is that blindly following a party&#8217;s positions and principles is not being free and independent, and will not always lead to the best person being elected, or to the best decisions being made for the country as a whole. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

He is one of the Twelve Prophets of the Jewish Hebrew Bible, also known as the Minor Prophets of the Christian Old Testament. We know practically nothing about the life or social status of Hosea. According to the Book of Hosea, he married the prostitute Gomer, the daughter of Diblatayim, at God&#8217;s command. He lived in the Northern Kingdom in the period 740&#8211;725 BCE. In Hosea 5:8 ff., there is a reference to the wars which led to the capture of the kingdom by the Assyrians (ca. 734&#8211;732 BCE). It is not certain if he has also experienced the destruction of Samaria, which is foreseen in Hosea 14:1. Hosea&#8217;s family life reflected the &#8220;adulterous&#8221; relationship which Israel had built with polytheistic gods. His children&#8217;s names made them like walking prophecies of the fall of the ruling dynasty and the severed covenant with God &#8212; much like the prophet Isaiah a generation later. Hosea is often seen as a &#8220;prophet of doom&#8221;, but underneath his message of destruction is a promise of restoration.&#8221; \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

In the tale, Sir Gawain accepts a challenge from a mysterious warrior who is completely green, from his clothes and hair to his beard and skin. The &#8220;Green Knight&#8221; offers to allow anyone to strike him with his axe if the challenger will take a return blow in a year and a day. Gawain accepts, and beheads him in one blow, only to have the Green Knight stand up, pick up his head, and remind Gawain to meet him at the appointed time. The story of Gawain&#8217;s struggle to meet the appointment and his adventures along the way demonstrate the spirit of chivalry and loyalty.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Its authorship is generally attributed to a person named Obadiah, which means &#8220;servant (or worshipper) of the Lord&#8221;. Obadiah is classified as a &#8220;minor prophet&#8221; in the Christian Bible due to the brevity of the writing (only 21 verses) and the content (prophetic material). An Old Testament prophet was (professedly) not only a person who was given divine insight into future events, but a person whom the Lord used to declare his word. The first nine verses in the book foretell total destruction in the land of Edom at the hand of the Lord. Obadiah writes that this destruction will be so complete that it will be even worse than a thief who comes at night, for not even a thief would destroy everything. The Lord will allow all allies of Edom to turn away and help chase Edom out of its land. What is the reason for such a harsh punishment? Verses ten through fourteen explain that when Israel (the Lord&#8217;s chosen people) was attacked, Edom refused to help them, thus acting like an enemy. What is even worse is that Edom and Israel share a common blood line through their founders who were brothers, Jacob and Esau. Because of this gross neglect of a relative, Edom will be covered with shame and destroyed forever. The final verses, fifteen through twenty-one, depict the restoration of Israel and the wiping out of the Edomites. Verse eighteen says that there will be no survivors from the house of Esau once the destruction is complete. Israel will become a holy place and its people will return from exile and inhabit the land once inhabited by the Edomites. The final verse of the prophecy places the Lord as King who will rule over all the mountains of Edom.&#8221;\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

However, the souls of the adversaries are still open to the light of Jesus: the light which transfigures through the miracle of His Icon: who is the Reaper, Who blesses the harvesting of good grains in the souls and uproots the tares of evil from there: this is what the master of the Bulgarian literature, Yordan Yovkov, relates with words of golden wheat and azure skies, taking the reader beyond the passions and mundane dust, through the suffering of the awaken conscience to the final victory of truth and good.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Anne Elliot, the story&#8217;s aged (27 year old) heroine, suffers from a decision that was forced upon her several years ago&#8212;to break off a relationship with Capn. Frederick Wentworth, the man she deeply loved. As Austen examines the causes and consequences of this action, she sketches for us the social complexities of being part of the upper-middle-class in England at the beginning of the nineteenth century.\n\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
