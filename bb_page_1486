In the early 20th century, when poetic style had become much looser, new audiences learned to appreciate her work. Here collected are many of her most contemplative, most rebellious, and &#8220;dark&#8221; works, expressing her frustrations with the behavioral confines of her times, and the confines of being human and unknowing of eternity.\n\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Paul prays for the spiritual well-being of the Ephesians and reminds them how sinful they were before they turned to Christ. He then speaks of his revelation, by which he was selected to preach to the Gentiles, for they can also be saved. Among other things, he urges the Ephesians to be humble, to avoid sexual immorality and foul speech, and to be united in Christ even though they are diverse in spiritual talents. He also gives advice to husbands and wives, children and fathers, and servants and masters. The letter concludes with an extended metaphor of the Christian as spiritual warrior. \n\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
