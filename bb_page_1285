{"ldata":[{"name":"z Twelfth Night Audiobook","id":99205,"description":"Twelfth Night by William Shakespeare (Tragedy, Romance)\n\nHidden and mistaken identities, requited and unrequited loves, pranks and jokes abound in this romantic comedy. \n\nLike many of Shakespeare&apos;s comedies, this one centres on mistaken identity. The leading character, Viola, is shipwrecked on the shores of Illyria during the opening scenes. She loses contact with her twin brother, Sebastian, whom she believes to be dead. Masquerading as a young page under the name Cesario, she enters the service of Duke Orsino through the help of the sea captain who rescues her. Orsino has convinced himself that he is in love with the bereaved Lady Olivia, whose father and brother have recently died, and who will have nothing to do with any suitors, the Duke included. Orsino decides to use &quot;Cesario&quot; as an intermediary to tell Olivia about his love for her. Olivia, believing Viola to be a man, falls in love with this handsome and eloquent messenger. Viola, in turn, has fallen in love with the Duke, who also believes Viola is a man, and who regards her as his confidant.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

(To this day, &#8220;tar baby&#8221; as an expression for a particularly sticky situation that is almost impossible to solve, has passed into the English language and common use.) Even people who have never read any of these tales will know exactly why you don&#8217;t throw a rabbit into a briar patch, mainly because Walt Disney produced his first movie ever to use professional actors with animation, called &#8220;Song of the South&#8221;, based on the Uncle Remus tales.\n\nJoel Chandler Harris, a newsman in Georgia, grew up listening to folktales told by the local black population. Later, he published his version of these tales in a series of stories printed in the &#8220;Atlanta Constitution.&#8221; The tales of, and by, Harris&#8217; chief character Uncle Remus, an old black man scrabbling to make his living in the post-Civil War South, were extremely popular and widely read. Harris&#8217; use of innovative spelling to give the reader a sense of the black dialect was considered novel.\n\nWhile this is not a book that will pass a current political correctness test, due to its use of labels for black folks which have gone out of polite conversation, Uncle Remus is a largely sympathetic look at post-war plantation life. Uncle Remus himself is a warm, folksy man of good humor and dry wit, and after finishing his animal stories, the remaining sayings and tales are a moment of history frozen in amber. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

A sequel to Grahame&#8217;s 1895 collection The Golden Age (some of its selections feature the same family of five children), Dream Days was first published in 1898 under the imprint John Lane: The Bodley Head. (The first six selections in the book had been previously published in periodicals of the day&#8212;in the Yellow Book, the New Review, and in Scribner&#8217;s Magazine in the United States.) The book is best known for its inclusion of Grahame&#8217;s classic story The Reluctant Dragon.\n\nLike its precursor volume, Dream Days received strong approval from the literary critics of the day. In the decades since, the book has perhaps suffered a reputation as a thinner and weaker sequel to The Golden Age&#8212;except for its single hit story. In one modern estimation, both books &#8220;paint a convincingly unsentimental picture of childhood, with the adults in these sketches totally out of touch with the real concerns of the young people around them, including their griefs and rages.&#8221; Its concern is chiefly with the lands of imagination, ranging from a reconnaisance of men of solitude, a disastrous introduction of a girl to the narrator&#8217;s private castle in the clouds, derring-do on the high seas, and, of course, an encounter with a dragon. Its concluding bittersweet story bids a reluctant farewell to the dream days of childhood.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Cervantes created a fictional origin for the story in the character of the Morisco historian, Cide Hamete Benengeli, whom he claims to have hired to translate the story from an Arabic manuscript he found in Toledo&#8217;s bedraggled old Jewish quarter.\nThe protagonist, Alonso Quixano, is a minor landowner who has read so many stories of chivalry that he descends into fantasy and becomes convinced he is a knight errant. Together with his companion Sancho Panza, the self-styled Don Quixote de la Mancha sets out in search of adventures. His &#8220;lady&#8221; is Dulcinea del Toboso, an imaginary object of his courtly love crafted from a neighbouring farmgirl by the illusion-struck &#8220;knight&#8221; (her real name is Aldonza Lorenzo, and she is totally unaware of his feelings for her. In addition, she never actually appears in the novel).\nPublished in two volumes a decade apart, Don Quixote is the most influential work of literature to emerge from the Spanish Golden Age and perhaps the entire Spanish literary canon. As a founding work of modern Western literature, it regularly appears at or near the top of lists of the greatest works of fiction ever published.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

It can be said that the novel set the tone for much science fiction to come. Its influence can clearly be seen in franchises such as Star Trek and Farscape. While Burroughs no doubt borrowed liberally from the pulp fiction of his day, particularly westerns and swashbuckling tales, the pacing and themes set the tone for the soft science fiction genre.\n\nThe protagonist, John Carter, with his proficiency in hand-to-hand combat and flirtations with beautiful alien women, could be said to have set the mold for later influential icons like Captain James T. Kirk and James Bond.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

He wrote many of his ghost stories to be read aloud in the long tradition of spooky Christmas Eve tales. His stories often use rural settings, with a quiet, scholarly protagonist getting caught up in the activities of supernatural forces. The details of horror are almost never explicit, the stories relying on a gentle, bucolic background to emphasize the awfulness of the otherworldly intrusions.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
