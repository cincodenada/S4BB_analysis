This story transports the listener from the fine air and freedom of the mountaintop to the confines of Frankfurt, back to the peaks again, bounding in flowered fields with goats at your heels and sky utterly surrounding you.\n\nWe meet Heidi when she is 5, led up the mountain by her aunt who has raised the orphan but must leave now for a position in Frankfurt. In a mountain cottage overlooking the valley is Heidi&#8217;s grandfather, and there with him the girl&#8217;s sweet, free nature expands with the vista. The author&#8217;s voice is straightforward, and so is our reader&#8217;s, with the child&#8217;s wonder, devotion, and sometimes humorous good intentions. When Heidi is taken from the mountains and nearly doesn&#8217;t make it back again, the most humorous as well as most heart-wringing scenes occur. All she learns during her absence from the mountain she brings back as seeds that will grow to benefit everyone around her. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
