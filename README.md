Intrigued by [Ars Technica's article about S4BB Limited](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/08/one-developer-makes-over-47000-of-blackberry-10s-120000-apps/), 
I paginated through the BB store's list of apps by S4BB Limited, and downloaded the JSON data for all 47,000+ of their apps.

The root directory has the JSON as I was given it, pp/ contains the same files pretty-printed with json\_xs, and /analysis has some quick analysis mainly via linecounting.

Conclusion: the vast majority of the apps (at least 46,000) of them are auto-generated "city guides" that required little to no effort per-app.
