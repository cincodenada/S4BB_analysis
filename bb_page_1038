In 1869 he set out to explore the Colorado and the Grand Canyon. He gathered nine men, four boats and food for ten months and set out from Green River, Wyoming, on May 24. Passing through dangerous rapids, the group passed down the Green River to its confluence with the Colorado River (then also known as the Grand River upriver from the junction), near present-day Moab, Utah.\n\nThe expedition&#8217;s route traveled through the Utah canyons of the Colorado River, which Powell described in his published diary as having &#8230;wonderful features&#8212;carved walls, royal arches, glens, alcove gulches, mounds and monuments. From which of these features shall we select a name? We decide to call it Glen Canyon. (Ironically, now almost completely submerged by Lake Powell, behind the Glen Canyon Dam.)\n\nOne man (Goodman) quit after the first month and another three (Dunn and the Howland brothers) left at Separation Rapid in the third, only two days before the group reached the mouth of the Virgin River on August 30 after traversing almost 1,500 km. The three who left the group late in the trip were later killed&#8212;probably by Indians.\n\nPowell retraced the route in 1871-1872 with another expedition, producing photographs, an accurate map, and various papers, including ethnographic reports of the area&#8217;s Native Americans and a monograph on their languages. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

It was he who initiated the hostilities by opening fire on Ft. Sumter in Charleston harbor, in April, 1861.\n\nIn July of that year, having taken command of the Confederate Army of the Potomac, he triumphed in the first serious clash of the war, at Manassas, Virginia. His army, aided by reinforcements from Johnston&#8217;s army in the Shenandoah Valley, routed a Federal army under General McDowell. Had it been his army instead that routed, it is possible the Civil War might have ended that same year, as the path to Richmond would have been wide open.\n\nThis is his account of the battle, including the strategic situation leading up to it. As an afterward, he added a very revealing appraisal of the relations between him and Confederate President Jefferson Davis, and the reasons why, in his opinion, the South failed to win its war of secession. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

It offers both detailed argumentation and passionate eloquence in opposition to the social and legal inequalities commonly imposed upon women by a patriarchal culture. Just as in &#8220;On Liberty,&#8221; Mill defends the emancipation of women on utilitarian grounds, convinced that the moral and intellectual advancement of women would result in greater happiness for everybody.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
