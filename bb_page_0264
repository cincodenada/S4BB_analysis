His parents emigrated to Canada shortly after that event, bringing with them, of course, the youth who was afterwards to become the Canadian author and historian. Mr. Dent received his primary education in Canadian schools, and afterwards studied law, becoming in due course a member of the Upper Canada Bar. He only practised for a few years, then returned to England to pursue a literary career, writing mostly for periodicals. After remaining in England for several years, Mr. Dent and his family moved to Boston, in America, for about two years. But he finally returned to Canada, accepting a journalistic position in Toronto. Mr. Dent proceeded to write &#8216;The Canadian Portrait Gallery&#8217;, which ran to four large volumes, &#8216;The Last Forty Years: Canada since the Union of 1841&#8242;, and a &#8216;History of the Rebellion in Upper Canada&#8217;.\nThis collected work of his short fiction, contributed by their author at considerable intervals to different periodicals, was published posthumously. The stories themselves are delightfully anchored in the physical geography of Upper Canada (or in the case of &#8216;Gagtooth&#8217;s Image&#8217;, Illinois), and have a mystical and spooky air about them.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

This was a time of widespread social disturbance, as the preamble describes; the Act sought to put an end to this. A group of twelve or more people, &#8220;being unlawfully, riotously and tumultuously assembled&#8221;, would be read a proclamation; they must disperse within an hour, on pain of death. The same fate would befall anyone preventing the reading of the proclamation, or damaging buildings while on a riot. If the law enforcement officers happened to injure or kill a rioter, they were immune from prosecution. The reading of the proclamation, the wording of which is detailed in the Act, was the necessary first step before action could be taken against the rioters. This gave us the phrase &#8220;to read the riot act&#8221;, to give a stern warning or rebuke. The Act was repealed in Britain in 1973, but had long since fallen into disuse there. A version is still in force in Canada.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
