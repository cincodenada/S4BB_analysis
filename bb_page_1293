In it Pater displays, with fullness and elaboration, his ideal of the aesthetic life, his cult of beauty as opposed to bare asceticism, and his theory of the stimulating effect of the pursuit of beauty as an ideal of its own. The principles of what would be known as the Aesthetic movement were partly traceable to this book; and its impact was particularly felt on one of the movement&#8217;s leading proponents, Oscar Wilde, a former student of Pater at Oxford. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Originally published in 1880 as a serial in Cornhill Magazine and Harper&#8217;s New Monthly Magazine, it is a structurally simple tragicomedy that recounts the conflict between a dull but sweet daughter and her brilliant, domineering father.\n\nThe book is often compared to Jane Austen&#8217;s work for the clarity and grace of its prose and its intense focus on family relationships. James was hardly a great admirer of Jane Austen, so he might not have regarded the comparison as flattering. In fact, James was not a great fan of Washington Square itself. He tried to read it over for inclusion in the New York Edition of his fiction (1907-1909) but found that he couldn&#8217;t, and the novel was not included. Other readers, though, have sufficiently enjoyed the book to make it one of the more popular works of the Jamesian canon. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

This is clear even from the subtitle, &#8220;Deceived in Freindship and Betrayed in Love,&#8221; which neatly undercuts the title.\n\nWritten in epistolary form, it resembles a fairy tale as much as anything else, featuring wild coincidences and turns of fortune, but Austen is determined to lampoon the conventions of romantic stories, right down to the utter failure of romantic fainting spells, which always turn out dreadfully for the female characters.\n\nIn this story one can see the development of Austen&#8217;s sharp wit and disdain for romantic sensibility, so characteristic of her later novels.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

As a satire, Flatland offered pointed observations on the social hierarchy of Victorian culture. However, the novella&#226;&#128;&#153;s more enduring contribution is its examination of dimensions; in a foreword to one of the many publications of the novella, noted science writer Isaac Asimov described Flatland as &#226;&#128;&#156;The best introduction one can find into the manner of perceiving dimensions.&#226;&#128;&#157; As such, the novella is still popular amongst mathematics, physics and computer science students.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Bassanio, an impoverished gentleman, uses the credit of his friend, the merchant Antonio, to borrow money from a wealthy Jew, Shylock. Antonio pledges to pay Shylock a pound of flesh if he defaults on the loan, which Bassanio will use to woo a rich heiress, Portia. A subplot concerns the elopement of Shylock&apos;s daughter Jessica with a Christian, Bassanio&apos;s friend Lorenzo. In its focus on love and marriage, the play shares certain concerns with Shakespeare&apos;s other comedies. Yet its depiction of the tensions between Jews and Christians in early modern Venice - and its highly dramatic trial scene in Act 4 - create darker currents in the play.\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
