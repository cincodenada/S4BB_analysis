         "description" : "A Discourse Upon the Origin and the Foundation of the Inequality Among Mankind by Jean-Jacques Rousseau\n\nThis work presents Rousseau&#8217;s belief in the profoundly transformational effects of the development of civilization on human nature, which Rousseau claims other political philosophers had failed to grasp. Specifically, before the onset of civilization, according to Rousseau, natural man lived a contented, solitary life, naturally good and happy. It is only with the onset of civilization, Rousseau claims, that humans become social beings, and, concomitant with their civilization, natural man becomes corrupted with the social vices of pride, vanity, greed and servility.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

The narrative was partly serialized in the New York Tribune, but was discontinued because Jacobs&#8217; depictions of the sexual abuse of female slaves were considered too shocking. It was published in book form in 1861. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Ballad of the White Horse by G. K. Chesterton (Poetry)\n\nAn English epic poem that follows the exploits of Alfred the Great in his defense of Christian civilization in England from the heathen nihilism of the North. Following a string of defeats at the hands of the invading Danes, a vision from heaven in the river island of Athelney fills Alfred with joy and hope. Though it gives no promise of victory in the coming struggle, it inspires him to rally his chieftains for a last stand against the invading hordes. His adventures lead throughout the country as he gathers his men, and take him through the Danish camps disguised as a minstrel before culminating in the Battle of Ethandune and the prophesying of the enemy&#8217;s subtle return in the ages to come.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Decades before Neal Armstrong took his &#8220;giant leap for mankind&#8221; two intrepid adventurers from Lympne, England, journeyed there using not a rocket, but an antigravity coating.\n\nMr. Bedford, who narrates the tale, tells of how he fell in with eccentric inventor Mr. Cavor, grew to believe in his researches, helped him build a sphere for traveling in space, and then partnered with him in an expedition to the Moon.\n\nWhat they found was fantastic! There was not only air and water, but the Moon was honeycombed with caverns and tunnels in which lived an advanced civilization of insect-like beings. While Bedford is frightened by them and bolts home, Cavor stays and is treated with great respect.\n\nSo why didn&#8217;t Armstrong and later astronauts find the evidence of all this? Well, according to broadcasts by Cavor over the newly-discovered radio technology, he told the Selenites too much about mankind, and apparently, they removed the welcome mat!\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Lost World by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (Fiction, Adventure)\n\nImagine a strange, tropical place that is almost inaccessible. Time appears to have stood still there. Species of animal and plant life not seen elsewhere on Earth, except in the fossil record, inhabit the place. The lakes heave with the shapes of huge grey bulks moving under the surface. The woods are places where chittering cries move about above your head, as powerful apes move swiftly in the canopy of leaves. Then, a tree splinters nearby, and a dinosaur steps out from his hiding place&#8230; and he&#8217;s eyeing YOU.\n\nJurassic Park? Not quite. The Lost World was an inspiration for Jurassic Park; in fact, a character in J.P. has the same name as one of the chief characters in The Lost World. It also inspired King Kong. But this is the original! Four adventurers go off to find the place shown in a dead man&#8217;s sketch book &#8211; they find a war between apes and Indians, prowling dinosaurs, a sparkly treasure hidden in the blue clay &#8211; they find the Lost World. And because of the treachery of a native guide, their means of escape is destroyed!\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Bab Ballads by W. S. Gilbert (Poetry, Humor)\n\nThe Bab Ballads are a collection of light verse by W. S. Gilbert, illustrated with his own comic drawings. Gilbert wrote the Ballads before he became famous for his comic opera librettos with Arthur Sullivan. In writing the Bab Ballads, Gilbert developed his unique &#8220;topsy-turvy&#8221; style, where the humour was derived by setting up a ridiculous premise and working out its logical consequences, however absurd. The Ballads also reveal Gilbert&#8217;s cynical and satirical approach to humour. They became famous on their own, as well as being a source for plot elements, characters and songs that Gilbert would recycle in the Gilbert and Sullivan operas. The Bab Ballads take their name from Gilbert&#8217;s childhood nickname, and he later began to sign his illustrations &#8220;Bab&#8221;.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

His fianc&#233;e is gone for the winter and though he begs her to write to help ease his boredom and pain she is stingy with her letters. She sends him what she calls a &#8216;ridiculous circular&#8217; which she states is very apropos of his sentimental passion for letters. In a sudden fit of mischief, malice and rheumatism, Carl decides to respond to the circular which results in bringing about the necessary distraction in a flurry of letters that do ease Carl&#8217;s boredom and pain but also bring him something else that he never quite expected.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
