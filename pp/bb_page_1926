         "description" : "What Prohibition Has Done to America by Fabian Franklin\n\t\t\nIn What Prohibition Has Done to America, Fabian Franklin presents a concise but forceful argument against the Eighteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Beginning in 1920, this Amendment prohibited the sale and manufacture of alcoholic beverages in the United States, until it was repealed in 1933. Franklin contends that the Amendment &#8220;is not only a crime against the Constitution of the United States, and not only a crime against the whole spirit of our Federal system, but a crime against the first principles of rational government.&#8221; Writing only two years after Prohibition began, he correctly predicts many of its disastrous consequences, such as runaway bootlegging and organized crime. The book is both a passionate defense of liberty, and a reminder to Americans of the perils of surrendering it.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Marcia deeply admires the man that Kate is to marry: handsome respected David Spafford. But on the eve of the wedding, Kate elopes with another man. Marcia is there when the note is found...the note that effectively breaks David&apos;s heart. Out of pity for his situation, Marcia offers to take Kate&apos;s place, in order to save David from humiliation. She grows in love for him, all the while aware that he&apos;s still grieving for his lost Kate. What will happen when Kate returns, fully intending to get David back? Will Marcia have the strength to fight for the man she now loves?\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

All have, in some way, touched or been touched by the loveable, young, simple-minded &#8220;idiot,&#8221; Barnaby Rudge.\n\nBarnaby&#8217;s good nature makes him a joy to most who know him Unfortunately, his eagerness to please and his gullibility make him an easy prey for the unscrupulous. Can he emerge unscathed when once he gets tangled up with the wrong crowd?\n\nOnce again, Dickens has managed to temper the horrific with his characteristic wit and humor, as he tells this tale based on the &#8220;no-popery&#8221; or Gordon riots of 1780.\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

After reading newspaper accounts of the British tanks, Tom takes a sheet of paper and sets out to design a better one from scratch. And fortunately, he can throw the whole family business behind his venture.\n\nHe has two problems: First, his friends and acquaintances are questioning his patriotism because he hasn&#8217;t enlisted as a rifleman for the front lines. Even his girl is worried his blood isn&#8217;t true-blue. But that&#8217;s because he is developing his tank in secret, and they don&#8217;t know he&#8217;s concentrating on winning the war the American way, with machines.\n\nThe second problem is that the German spies have penetrated the secret of what is being built in the high-security shop on the Swift property. And they will stop at nothing to steal its design &#8211; not kidnapping Tom, and not kidnapping the tank itself, complete with crew.\n\nTom and his buddies had better work fast, or the American riflemen are going to find the Kaiser&#8217;s soldiers using American-designed tanks against them!\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "A Lady&#8217;s Visit to the Gold Diggings of Australia in 1852-53 by Ellen Clacy\n\t\t\n&#8220;If you have visions of a middle-aged parasol-bearing lady smiling sweetly from her carriage as she tours Bendigo think again. In 1852, 20 year old clergyman&#8217;s daughter Ellen and her brother boarded ship for Melbourne then set off to walk to Bendigo. Dressed in her blue serge skirt which doubled as nightwear, she camped under a tent made of blankets, had mutton, damper and tea most meals and on arrival lent her hand to gold washing. And seemed to enjoy it !\nAnd amongst other things she tells of colonial life , transportation, emigration and other gold-fields.\nBut you will need to listen to hear more about bush-rangers and orphans as well as what she did with her parasol.&#8221;\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Uneasy Money by P. G. Wodehouse\n\t\t\nUneasy Money is a romantic comedy by P.G. Wodehouse, published during the First World War, it offers light escapism. More romantic but only a little less humorous that his mature works, it tells of the vicissitudes of poor Lord Dawlish, who inherits five million dollars, but becomes a serially disappointed groom.\n\nWhen the story opens Bill (Lord Dawlish, a thoroughly pleasant man) is engaged to a demanding actress. His first thought when hearing of his massive legacy from a stranger whose tendency to slice he once cured on a West Country golf course is of the disappointed relatives. His trip to the USA attempting to give back the windfall results in complication after complication, including firearms and burglaries as well as the usual human misunderstandings that accompany any human life.\n\nUneasy Money was first published as a serial in the Saturday Evening Post in the USA from December 1915, and in the UK in Strand Magazine starting December 1916. It first appeared in book form on March 17, 1916 by D. Appleton Co., New York, and later in the UK (on October 4, 1917) by Methuen Co., London.\n\nA silent, black-and-white film version was made in 1918.\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "More William by Richmal Crompton\n\t\t\n&quot;It was on Christmas Day that the centipede appeared on Aunt Evangeline&apos;s plate, the library clock was found mysteriously dismantled, and the conjuring trick with the egg went disastrously wrong. But as William&apos;s Aunt Lucy told him, A Busy Day is a Happy Day - and William is always eager to please adults. The terror of the Brown family is back, leaving a trail of havoc behind him - with the very best of intentions.&quot; (More William book jacket)\nLovers of British family sitcoms are either already William fans, or are likely to become avid followers of the dogged and imaginative child and his not always patient family.\n\nRichmal Crompton&apos;s William series of books tells the relationship between adults and children from a child&apos;s perspective hilariously highlighting the different viewpoints. Most of us have been William (e.g. children who cannot understand the strange and arbitrary or contradictory rules the adult world imposes) or have dealt with a William (never sure whether he is the little boy pointing out the emperor&apos;s lack of clothes or a nuisance defending his crimes with infuriating (il)logic. Although the world of middle class homes with cooks and gardeners has long vanished generations of adults and children alike laugh at William&apos;s explotis, and often sympathise with either the hero or his long-suffering family.\n\nSomehow Crompton&apos;s William is so real, though somewhat larger than life, that he reduces the other characters to bit-players, and her female leads seem restricted to mere supporting roles. Despite (or perhaps because of) this her stories are enjoyed by girls as much as boys.\n\nMore William is the second book in the series and was published in 1922. It contains fourteen hilarious family comedies.\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
