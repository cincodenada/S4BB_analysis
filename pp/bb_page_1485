         "description" : "The Works of Tacitus Vol. I by Thomas Gordon (History)\n\nThe historical works of Tacitus are a history of the period from A.D. 14 to 96 in thirty volumes. Although many of the works were lost (only books 1-5 of the Histories and 1-6 and 11-16 of the Annals survive), enough remains to provide a good sense of Tacitus&#8217;s political and moral philosophy.\n\nTacitus recognized the necessity for strong rulers but argued that more should be done to manage the succession of power and allow for the ascension of talent. He asserted that it was the dynastic ambitions of Rome&#8217;s many emperors that caused the decline of moral and political life and precluded the possibility of recruiting leaders of real ability. Moreover, the dynastic temptation caused political instability because military force was now required for political change. His works point to the necessity of systematic institutional restraints on power for the preservation of liberty.\n\nGordon&#8217;s translation and his lengthy Discourses on Tacitus bring Tacitus&#8217; ideas up to date and apply them to the British state of the early 18th century. (Description from Online Library of Liberty)\n\nThis is the first of four volumes of Gordon&#8217;s Tacitus edition.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The History of Tom Jones, A Foundling by Henry Fielding (Historical Fiction)\n\nTom Jones is considered one of the first prose works describable as a novel. The novel is divided into 18 smaller books. Tom Jones is a foundling discovered on the property of a very kind, wealthy landowner, Squire Allworthy. Tom grows into a vigorous and lusty, yet honest and kind-hearted, youth. He develops affection for his neighbor&#8217;s daughter, Sophia Western. On one hand, their love reflects the romantic comedy genre popular in 18th-century Britain. However, Tom&#8217;s status as a bastard causes Sophia&#8217;s father and Allworthy to oppose their love; this criticism of class friction in society acted as a biting social commentary. The inclusion of prostitution and sexual promiscuity in the plot was also original for its time, and also acted as the foundation for criticism of the book&#8217;s &#8220;lowness.&#8221;\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Pollyanna by Eleanor H. Porter (Children)\n\nPollyanna tells the story of Pollyanna Whittier, a young girl who goes to live with her wealthy Aunt Polly after her father&#8217;s death. Pollyanna&#8217;s philosophy of life centers around what she calls &#8220;The Glad Game&#8221;: she always tries to find something to be glad about in every situation, and to always do without delay whatever she thinks is right. With this philosophy, and her own sunny personality, she brings so much gladness to her aunt&#8217;s dispirited New England town that she transforms it into a pleasant, healthy place to live. Eventually, however, even Pollyanna&#8217;s robust optimism is put to the test when she loses the use of her legs in an accident.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

It is a country with an &#8216;ideal&#8217; form of communism, in which everything really does belong to everybody, everyone does the work they want to, and everyone is alright with that. This country uses gold for chamber pots and prison chains, pearls and diamonds for children&#8217;s playthings, and requires that a man and a woman see each other exactly as they are, naked, before getting married.

         "description" : "Shakespeare Monologues, Volume 1 by William Shakespeare (Poetry)\n\nWilliam Shakespeare (April 26, 1564 &#8211; April 23, 1616) remains widely to be considered the single greatest playwright of all time. He wrote in such a variety of genres &#8211; tragedy, comedy, romance, &amp;c &#8211; that there is always at least one monologue in each of his plays. Some of these teach a lesson, some simply characterize Shakespeare at his best, some are funny, some sad, but all are very moving. Each monologue will touch everybody differently. Some people will be so moved by a particular monologue that they will want to record it. So here are the first fifteen monologues.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "No Thoroughfare by Charles Dickens (Literature)\n\nTwo boys from the Foundling Hospital are given the same name, with disastrous consequences in adulthood. Two associates, wishing to right the wrong, are commissioned to find a missing heir. Their quest takes them from fungous wine cellars in the City of London to the sunshine of the Mediterranean &#8212; across the Alps in winter. Danger and treachery would prevail were it not for the courage of the heroine and the faithful company servant.\n\nThe story contains crafted descriptions, well-drawn and diverse characters, eerie and exotic backgrounds, mystery, semi-concealed identities, brinkmanship with death, romance, the eventual triumph of Good over Evil, and many other elements expected in classic Dickens.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

The argument is dependent upon an assumption that the writings be commodified, for the reason why the author is unable to possibly give consent to multiple publishers is due to the author&#8217;s will &#8211; to communicate with the public &#8211; necessitating the profitability of the publisher, for, it is assumed, there is no way to communicate with the public at large without a great expense which can only be borne by a publishing firm.

         "description" : "Selected Poems of John Clare, Volume 1 (Poetry)\n\nJohn Clare (1793 &#8211; 1864) was a farm labourer in the village of Helpstone, Northamptonshire, who became arguably England&#8217;s greatest nature poet. He rose to fame when his &#8216;Poems Descriptive of Rural Life and Scenery&#8217; was published in 1820. His language preserves many local dialect words in a mixture of classical forms and heart-felt love of country life and nature. The poems in this collection are from his early career, and are largely free of pointers to his later mental illness.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Marx said himself that his aim was &#8220;to bring a science (i.e. political economy) by criticism to the point where it can be dialectically represented&#8221;, and in this way to &#8220;reveal the law of motion of modern society&#8221;. By showing how capitalist development was the precursor of a new, socialist mode of production, he aimed to provide a scientific foundation for the modern labour movement. In preparation for his book, he studied the economic literature available in his time for a period of twelve years, mainly in the British Museum in London.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Old Curiosity Shop by Charles Dickens (Literature)\n\nThe Old Curiosity Shop tells the story of Little Nell, a beautiful and virtuous young girl who lives with her grandfather in his shop of curiosities. Her grandfather loves her dearly, and Nell does not complain, but she lives a lonely existence without friends of her own age. Her only friend is Kit, an honest young lad who works at the shop, and whom she is teaching to write. Unbeknownst to Nell, her grandfather is obsessed with their precarious financial position and is attempting to make Nell a good inheritance by winning at cards. He keeps these nocturnal activities a secret, but borrows heavily from the evil Quilp, a dwarf, in order to raise new capital. In the end, he gambles away what little money they own, and Quilp seizes the opportunity to take possession of the shop and make Nell&#8217;s and her grandfather&#8217;s lives a misery. Indeed, her grandfather suffers a breakdown, which leaves him bereft of his wits. Courageously, Nell decides to escape Quilp, and she and her grandfather run away to the country to live as beggars, travelling into the Midlands of England.\n\nThere, then, follow the multifarious adventures of Nell and her grandfather, Quilp and his sly minions and accomplices, who would be Nell&#8217;s vehement pursuers throughout the entire story, the noble schoolmaster, and many, many other personages as bright and memorable as Dickens&#8217; heroes always are. \n\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
