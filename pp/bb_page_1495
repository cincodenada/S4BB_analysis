         "description" : "Northanger Abbey by Jane Austen (Romance, Fiction, Comedy)\n\nNorthanger Abbey follows Catherine Morland and family friends Mr. and Mrs. Allen as they visit Bath, England. Seventeen year-old Catherine spends her time visiting newly-made friends, such as Isabella Thorpe, and going to balls. Catherine finds herself pursued by Isabella&#8217;s brother John Thorpe (Catherine&#8217;s brother James&#8217;s friend from university), and by Henry Tilney. She also becomes friends with Eleanor Tilney, Henry&#8217;s younger sister. Henry captivates her with his view on novels and his knowledge of history and the world. General Tilney (Henry and Eleanor&#8217;s father) invites Catherine to visit their estate, Northanger Abbey, which, because she has been reading Ann Radcliffe&#8217;s gothic novel The Mysteries of Udolpho, Catherine expects to be dark, ancient and full of fantastical mystery.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Meditations on First Philosophy by Ren&#233; Descartes. Translated by John Veitch.\n\nAfter several years working on a treatise putting forth his mechanistic philosophy and physics, Descartes shelved the project when his contemporary, Galileo, was charged with heresy. That work, The World, was only published after Descartes&#8217; death. It seems that Descartes must have had this, in part at least, in mind when writing his more famous philosophical works. This is especially clear in the Meditations, not only in the obsequiousness of the Letter of Dedication, but also in the specific mode of argument, which does not seek merely to found science upon grounds acceptable to religious authority, but to specifically found a mathematical science; one which clearly privileges mathematical demonstrations even over common sense judgments based upon everyday and constant experience. His Copernicanism, put forth posthumously in The World, would require just such a defense.\n\nThe Meditations are a central work of early modern philosophy, and play a crucial role in the conceptual development of basic perspectives and problems in the Western tradition, including substance dualism, external world skepticism, and the modern notion of the subject.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Translated by Richard Francis Burton (Adventure, Fairy Tales)\n\nThis is a collection of stories collected over thousands of years by various authors, translators and scholars. The are an amalgam of mythology and folk tales from the Indian sub-continent, Persia, and Arabia. No original manuscript has ever been found for the collection, but several versions date the collection&#8217;s genesis to somewhere between AD 800-900. The stories are wound together under the device of a long series of cliff-hangers told by Shahrazad to her husband Shahryar, to prevent him from executing her. Many tales that have become independently famous come from the Book, among them Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves, and the voyages of Sinbad the Sailor. This collection comes from the first of sixteen volumes translated by Burton. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "South! The Story of Shackleton&#8217;s Last Expedition 1914-1917 by Ernest Shackleton (Adventure, Travel, Science, Sea stories)\n\nShackleton&#8217;s most famous expedition was planned to be an attempt to cross Antarctica from the Weddell Sea south of the Atlantic, to the Ross Sea south of the Pacific, by way of the Pole. It set out from London on 1 August 1914, and reached the Weddell Sea on January 10, 1915, where the pack ice closed in on the Endurance. The ship was broken by the ice on 27 October 1915. The 28 crew members managed to flee to Elephant Island, bringing three small boats with them. Shackleton and five other men managed to reach the southern coast of South Georgia in one of the small boats (in a real epic journey). Shackleton managed to rescue all of the stranded crew from Elephant Island without loss in the Chilean&#8217;s navy seagoing steam tug Yelcho, on August 30, 1916, in the middle of the Antarctic winter.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Life and Adventures of Nat Love by Nat Love (Adventure)\n\nNat Love was born a slave, emancipated into abject poverty, grew up riding the range as a cowboy and spent his maturity riding the rails as a Pullman Porter. For me, the most amazing thing about him is that despite the circumstances of his life, which included being owned like a farm animal solely because of the color of his skin and spending later decades living and working as an equal with white coworkers, he was an unrepentant racist! Convinced that the only good Indian was a dead one, and that all Mexicans were &#8220;greasers&#8221; and/or &#8220;bums,&#8221; he rarely passed up a chance to shoot a member of either group, whether in self-defense or cold blood, and shows no sign of having appreciated the difference. At one point, he fell in love with a Mexican girl but, apparently unable to tolerate this reality, considered her &#8220;Spanish.&#8221; Nat Love was a fascinating character who lived in equally interesting times, and one only wishes his autobiography was much longer and more detailed.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "What&#8217;s Wrong With the World by G. K. Chesterton (Politics, Humor, Essay/Short Nonfiction)\n\nGilbert Keith Chesterton (1874&#8211;1936) has been called the &#8220;prince of paradox.&#8221; Time magazine observed of his writing style: &#8220;Whenever possible Chesterton made his points with popular sayings, proverbs, allegories&#8212;first carefully turning them inside out.&#8221; His prolific and diverse output included journalism, philosophy, poetry, biography, Christian apologetics, fantasy and detective fiction.\n\nThe title of Chesteron&#8217;s 1910 collection of essays was inspired by a title given to him two years earlier by The Times newspaper, which had asked a number of authors to write on the topic: &#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with the world?&#8221;. Chesterton&#8217;s answer at that time was the shortest of those submitted &#8211; he simply wrote: &#8220;Dear Sirs, I am. Sincerely yours, G.K. Chesterton&#8221;. In this collection he gives a fuller treatment of the question, with his characteristic conservative wit. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Garis (Children, Animals)\n\nOnce upon a time there lived in a small house built underneath the ground two curious little folk, with their father, their mother, their uncle and Jane Fuzzy-Wuzzy. Jane Fuzzy-Wuzzy was the nurse, hired girl and cook, all in one, and the reason she had such a funny name was because she was a funny cook. She had long hair, a sharp nose, a very long tail and the brightest eyes you ever saw. She could stay under water a long time, and was a fine swimmer. In fact, Jane Fuzzy-Wuzzy was a big muskrat, and the family she worked for was almost as strange as she was. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
