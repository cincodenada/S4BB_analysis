The poems follow but also depart from the Petrarchan tradition of sonnets written by a frustrated male lover to an unattainable idealized female beloved. Shakespeare&#8217;s sonnets are addressed to both male and female lovers: the androgynous &#8220;young man&#8221; and the alluring yet dangerously sexual &#8220;dark lady.&#8221;\n\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Profoundly insightful, it is also a beautifully written story that begins as Siddhartha, son of an Indian Brahman, leaves his family and begins a lifelong journey towards Enlightenment. On the way he faces the entire range of human experience and emotion: he lives with ascetics, meets Gotama the Buddha, learns the art of love from Kamala the courtesan, and is transformed by the simple philosophy of the ferryman Vasudeva whose wisdom comes not from learned teachings but from observing the River. Hermann Hesse (1877-1962) was a German-Swiss novelist, poet, and painter. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1946.\n\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

It introduces the reader to Plantagenet and Glencora Palliser, as they court, marry, and as Plantagenet sets out on his political career, which is carried on in the foreground or background throughout the series. Each novel has a focus on other particular characters, as well. In this one, it is the dilemma of Alice Vavasor, who is a young woman choosing between two suitors: one who has all the best qualities, but who prefers a retiring private life, and another, whose qualities are doubtful, but who is ambitious for public office. There is also a comic subplot involving a widowed aunt, who also must choose between two suitors: Mr. Cheeseacre, a dull but stable farmer, and Capt. Bellfield, a charming but somewhat erratic retired military man.\n\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Five Weeks in a Balloon by Jules Verne (Adventure, Teen / Young adult) language: Danish\n\n\nFive Weeks in Balloon: Audio for suspense novel by Jules Verne. Translation after 23 of the French Academy award-winning version. Andreas Schou&apos;s Press, the 1883rd\n\nIf you have to put into words what science is about geography, it is to describe and analyze the earth&apos;s surface, its landscapes, people and wildlife - to delve into its soil and to study how the wind blows. For only a half century ago were mighty territory in Central Africa virtually unknown to Europeans. Heralded by sporadic sources that the vast continent saved to mysterious lands, lush sprawling forests, endless savannahs and lakes as large as the garden. But it was extremely difficult to explore the continent and very risky for those who tried. Many died of disease and exhaustion in the impenetrable jungle wilderness, others thirsted to death in the deserts and again others were murdered in bestial ways by hostile natives.\n\nThe indomitable English globetrotter dr. Samuel Fergusson set out to implement the risky experiment to explore Africa from east to west through his balloon, accompanied by his close friend Scotsman Dick Kennedy and the faithful servant Joe. The novel contains not only the three fictional heroes unique process of the unknown country, but also gives an insight into the many authentic expeditions, which was then attempted in Central Africa, not infrequently with a tragic final.\n\nMuch has changed in our knowledge on the continent and not least our view of the African peoples have been considerably more nuanced since Jules Verne wrote the novel in 1863. Nevertheless, the novel is an interesting and rare photo of a native African, from before the time when Europeans really left its mark on the culture and landscape.\n\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Sonnets from the Portuguese by Elizabeth Barrett (Romance, Poetry)\n\nSonnets from the Portuguese chronicles one of the most famous romances in history. The renowned Victorian poet Elizabeth Barrett wrote the sonnet sequence during her courtship by Robert Browning, and later presented them to him as a wedding gift. Robert was astounded by the quality of the poetry, and encouraged her to publish, but Elizabeth objected on the grounds that the content was too personal. At last, Robert prevailed, and Elizabeth published her sonnets. The title of the book comes from a joke between Robert and Elizabeth Browning. Elizabeth was too embarrassed to publish the sonnets as a personal chronicle, so she decided to pretend they were a translation from a foreign language. Robert&#8217;s nickname for her was &#8220;My Little Portuguese&#8221; due to her dark hair and olive complexion, and so the sequence was forever known as &#8220;Sonnets from the Portuguese.&#8221; \n\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Love Letters of Abelard and Heloise by Peter Abelard and Heloise (Romance)\n\nHeloise was a strong-willed and gifted woman who was fluent in Latin, Greek and Hebrew, and came from a lower social standing than Abelard. At age 19, and living under her uncle Fulbert&#8217;s roof, Heloise fell in love with Abelard, who she was studying under. Not only did they have a clandestine affair of a sexual nature, they had a child, Astrolabe, out of wedlock. Discovered by the Fulbert (who was a Church official), Abelard was assaulted by a hired thug and castrated, and Heloise entered a convent. Abelard was exiled to Brittany, where he lived as monk. Eventually Heloise became abbess of the Oratory of the Paraclete, an abbey which Abelard had founded.\n\nIt was at this time that they exchanged their famous letters, presented in this book. The letters, originally written in Latin, are passionate both in the remembrance of lost love, and the attempt to reconcile that love with their respective monastic duty to remain chaste. The tension between these two poles generates a huge amount of emotional electricity. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

No expense has been spared to obtain the oldest translations of the Bible, copies of the ancient manuscripts, and other facilities to make the revision as perfect as possible.\nThe paragraph form has been adopted in preference to the division by verse, which is a modern mode of division, never used in the ancient scriptures. But, for convenience of reference, the numbers of the verses are retained.\n\nAll quotations from the Old Testament are distinctly indicated, and the poetic form is restored to those which appear as poetry in the original.\n\nThe revisers have been guided in their labors by the following rules prescribed by the Union:\n\nRULES FOR THE REVISION OF THE ENGLISH NEW TESTAMENT.\n\nThe received Greek text, critically edited, with known errors corrected, must be followed.\n\nThe common English version must be the basis of revision, and only such alterations must be made as the exact meaning of the text and the existing state of the language may require.\n\nThe exact meaning of the inspired text, as that text expressed it to those who understood the original Scriptures at the time they were first written, must be given in corresponding words and phrases, so far as they can be found in the English language, with the least possible obscurity or indefiniteness.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Home and the World by Rabindranath Tagore (Romance, Politics, Historical Fiction)\n\nRabindranath Tagore (1861&#8211;1941), also known by the sobriquet Gurudev, was a Bengali poet, Brahmo religionist, visual artist, playwright, novelist, and composer whose works reshaped Bengali literature and music in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He became Asia&#8217;s first Nobel laureate when he won the 1913 Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nThe Home and the World is a 1916 novel, set in the estate of the rich Bengali noble Nikhil. He lives happily with his beautiful wife Bimala until the appearance of his friend and radical revolutionist, Sandip.\n\nSandip, a passionate and active man, is a contradiction to the peace-loving and somewhat passive Nikhil. He easily attracts the innocent and unsuspecting Bimala, creating a love triangle.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Golden Bough by James Frazer (Religion)\n\nThe Golden Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion is a wide-ranging comparative study of mythology and religion, written by Scottish anthropologist Sir James George Frazer (1854&#8211;1941). It offered a modernist approach, discussing religion dispassionately as a cultural phenomenon, rather than from a theological perspective. Although most of its theories have subsequently been exploded (the most famous one being that of the relationship between magic, religion and science), its impact on contemporaneous European literature was substantial.\n\nThe Golden Bough attempts to define the shared elements of religious belief, ranging from ancient belief systems to relatively modern religions such as Christianity. Its thesis is that old religions were fertility cults that centered around the worship of, and periodic sacrifice of, a sacred king. This king was the incarnation of a dying and reviving god, a solar deity who underwent a mystic marriage to a goddess of the earth, who died at the harvest, and was reincarnated in the spring. Frazer claims that this legend is central to almost all of the world&#8217;s mythologies, and he offers a plethora of colourful examples from all over the world. Moreover, his book is written in an admirable style, seldom excelled by his more modern colleagues.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Eighty Years and More - Reminiscences 1815-1897 by  Elizabeth Cady Stanton\n\nElizabeth Cady Stanton was one of the premier movers in the original women&#8217;s rights movement, along with Susan B. Anthony, her best friend for over 50 years. While Elizabeth initially stayed home with her husband and many babies and wrote the speeches, Susan went on the road to bring the message of the women&#8217;s rights movement to an often hostile public. When black men were given the vote in 1870, Susan and Elizabeth led the women&#8217;s rights establishment of the time to withhold support for a bill that would extend to black men the rights still denied for women of all colors. The two women worked for over 50 years on the women&#8217;s rights cause, yet neither lived to see women get the right to vote when it finally came in 1920.\nElizabeth begins her memoirs with this quotation, &#8220;Social science affirms that woman&#8217;s place in society marks the level of civilization.&#8221; She dedicates this book to &#8220;SUSAN B. ANTHONY, MY STEADFAST FRIEND FOR HALF A CENTURY&#8221;. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Within three months, 120,000 copies are alleged to have been distributed throughout the colonies, which themselves totaled only four million free inhabitants, making it the best-selling work in 18th-century America. Its total sales in both America and Europe reached 500,000 copies. It convinced many colonists, including George Washington and John Adams, to seek redress in political independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain, and argued strongly against any compromise short of independence.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Tragedy of Pudd&apos;nhead Wilson by Mark Twain (Mystery, Humor, Satire)\n\nIn one of his later novels, the master storyteller spins a tale of two children switched at infancy. A slave takes on the identity of master and heir while the rightful heir is condemned to live the life of a slave. Twain uses this vehicle to explore themes of nature vs. nurture, racial bigotry and moral relativism. The case of mistaken identity is a theme that Twain explored also in THE PRINCE AND THE PAUPER; in THE TRAGEDY OF PUDD&#8217;NHEAD WILSON he turns the theme into a well-crafted detective story. It is unfortunate that this is one of Twain&#8217;s lesser known works as it is one of his most enjoyable reads.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
