         "description" : "The Book of Lieh-Tz&#252; by Lieh-Tzu. Translated by Lionel Giles (1875-1958). (History, Literature)\n\nThe Liezi (Chinese: &#21015;&#23376;; pinyin: Li&#232;z&#301;; Wade-Giles: Lieh Tzu; literally &#8220;Book of Master Lie&#8221;) is a Daoist text attributed to Lie Yukou, a circa 5th century BCE Hundred Schools of Thought philosopher, but Chinese and Western scholars believe it was compiled around the 4th century CE.\n\nDuring the reign of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, the Liezi was designated a Daoist classic, completing the trilogy with the more famous Daodejing and Zhuangzi.\n\nThe Liezi is generally considered to be the most practical of the major Daoist works, compared to the philosophical writings of Laozi and the poetic narrative of Zhuangzi. Although the Liezi has not been extensively published in the West, some passages are well known.\n\nThe book explores a number of classic Taoist themes, such as the relativity of all knowledge, the ideals of simplicity and effortless spontaneity, and the importance of calmly accepting death.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Esperanto Teacher by Helen Fryer (Languages, Instruction)\n\nThe international language Esperanto was first released to the world in 1887, when L. L. Zamenhof published his first book, &#8220;Dr. Esperanto&#8217;s International Language&#8221;. Since that time, many learning books have been developed to help the beginner attain a proficiency in the language. Helen Fryer&#8217;s &#8220;Esperanto Teacher&#8221; is one of the earliest of these attempts in English. Divided into 45 short and easy lessons and supplemented with sections on joining words, exclamations, compound words, arrangement of words in a sentence, words used with the object, the 16 rules of grammar and list of common useful expressions, as well as a number of translated texts for the new Esperantist to practice his/her skills, this book contains everything one needs to gain a proficiency in the language.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "North and South by Elizabeth Cleghorn Gaskell (Literature, Romance)\n\nSet in Victorian England, North and South is the story of Margaret Hale, a young woman whose life is turned upside down when her family relocates to northern England. As an outsider from the agricultural south, Margaret is initially shocked by the aggressive northerners of the dirty, smoky industrial town of Milton. But as she adapts to her new home, she defies social conventions with her ready sympathy and defense of the working poor. Her passionate advocacy leads her to repeatedly clash with charismatic mill owner John Thornton over his treatment of his workers. While Margaret denies her growing attraction to him, Thornton agonizes over his foolish passion for her, in spite of their heated disagreements. As tensions mount between them, a violent unionization strike explodes in Milton, leaving everyone to deal with the aftermath in the town and in their personal lives.\n\nElizabeth Gaskell serialized North and South between September 1854 and January 1855 in Charles Dickens&#8217;s magazine Household Words. Upon its publication, Gaskell established herself as a novelist capable of serious discourse on social responsibility and advocacy for change in defiance of established authority.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Offences Against One&#8217;s Self: Paederasty by Jeremy Bentham\n\nJeremy Bentham (1748-1832) was an English jurist, philosopher, and legal and social reformer. He was a political radical and a leading theorist in Anglo-American philosophy of law. He is best known as an early advocate of utilitarianism and animal rights who influenced the development of liberalism.\n\nThe essay Offences Against One&#8217;s Self (c. 1785), argued for the liberalisation of laws prohibiting homosexuality. The essay remained unpublished during Bentham&#8217;s lifetime for fear of offending public morality. It was finally published for the first time in 1931. \n\nThis recording was catalogued on 28th July 2007, the 40th anniversary of the coming into force in the UK of the Sexual Offences Act 1967, which decriminalised male homosexuality for the first time (though with restrictions). \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Golden Age by Kenneth Grahame (Children, Essay/Short Nonfiction, Memoirs)\n\nThe Golden Age is a collection of reminiscences of childhood, written by Kenneth Grahame and originally published in book form in 1895, in London by The Bodley Head, and in Chicago by Stone &amp; Kimball. (The Prologue and six of the stories had previously appeared in the National Observer, the journal then edited by William Ernest Henley.) Widely praised upon its first appearance&#8212;Algernon Charles Swinburne, writing in the Daily Chronicle, called it &#8220;one of the few books which are well-nigh too praiseworthy for praise&#8221;&#8212;the book has come to be regarded as a classic in its genre.\n\nTypical of his culture and his era, Grahame casts his reminiscences in imagery and metaphor rooted in the culture of Ancient Greece; to the children whose impressions are recorded in the book, the adults in their lives are &#8220;Olympians,&#8221; while the chapter titled &#8220;The Argonauts&#8221; refers to Perseus, Apollo, Psyche, and similar figures of Greek mythology. Grahame&#8217;s reminiscences, in The Golden Age and in the later Dream Days (1898), were notable for their conception &#8220;of a world where children are locked in perpetual warfare with the adult &#8216;Olympians&#8217; who have wholly forgotten how it feels to be young&#8221;&#8212;a theme later explored by J. M. Barrie and other authors. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Adventures of Jimmie Dale by Frank L. Packard (Mystery)\n\nFrank Lucius Packard (February 2, 1877 &#8211; February 17, 1942) was a Canadian novelist born in Montreal, Quebec. He worked as a civil engineer on the Canadian Pacific Railway. He later wrote a series of mystery novels, the most famous of which featured a character called Jimmie Dale. Jimmie Dale is a wealthy playboy by day, with a Harvard education and membership to New York City&#8217;s ultra-exclusive private club St. James. But at night he puts on a costume and becomes The Grey Seal, who enters businesses or homes and cracks safes, always leaving a diamond shaped, grey paper &#8220;seal&#8221; behind to mark his conquest, but never taking anything. He was just doing it for &#8220;the sheer deviltry of it&#8221; at first, but when a woman catches him, she blackmails him to war on certain crime organizations. Jimmie Dale/The Grey Seal is often credited with greatly influencing and popularizing later pulp and comic book heroes. The foppish playboy by-day-crimefighter-by-night routine had a precursor in The Scarlet Pimpernel, but it was Jimmie Dale that brought the idea into a contemporary setting and added the idea of a costume and mask for his secret identity, serving as a possible influence for characters like Zorro and The Shadow. He also established the concept of a hero&#8217;s secret hideout or lair, The Sanctuary, a precursor of the Batcave or the Fortress of Solitude. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Bosboom-Toussaint (Romance) (Dutch)\n\nAn impoverished young nobleman, Leopold, has unexpectedly been left a large fortune at the death of a distant relative &#8211; under one condition: that he marry a young cousin of hers. This young woman, called Francis, has been raised by her grandfather, who is a general. She has had an unconventional upbringing which has left her independent, outspoken and rough in her manners, with a love for horse riding and fencing, and a resolution never to marry. This unwomanly behavior has earned her the nickname &#8220;Major Frans&#8221;. Leopold falls in love with her, and decides to try and win her as his bride. This book, written in 1874, is considered a character novel influenced by the emerging women emancipation movements of the time. Recording in Dutch.\n\nEen arme jonker, Leopold, wordt onverwacht een grote erfenis in het vooruitzicht gesteld na de dood van een oud-tante &#8211; onder &#233;&#233;n voorwaarde: hij moet met een nichtje van haar trouwen. Deze jonge vrouw, die Francis heet, is opgegroeid onder de hoede van haar grootvader, een generaal in het leger. Ze heeft een onconventionele opvoeding gehad die haar onafhankelijk van geest, brutaal en ruw in haar manier van doen heeft gemaakt; ze houdt van schermen en snelle paarden, en heeft zich voorgenomen om nooit te trouwen. Dit on-vrouwelijke gedrag heeft geleid tot haar bijnaam: &#8220;Majoor Frans&#8221;. Leopold wordt verliefd op haar, en besluit om te proberen haar voor zich te winnen. Dit boek, geschreven in 1874, wordt beschouwd als een karakterroman als reactie op de opkomende vrouwen-emancipatie bewegingen in die tijd.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Fanny Herself by Edna Ferber (Fiction)\n\nFanny Herself is the story of Fanny Brandeis, a sensitive, young Jewish girl coming of age in the Midwest at the turn of the 20th century. It is generally considered to have been based on Ferber&#8217;s own experiences growing up in Appleton, Wisconsin. Fanny&#8217;s inner struggle between her compassionate, artistic side and her desire for financial independence as a successful young businesswoman is the recurring theme of the novel. Ferber&#8217;s engaging style of writing will quickly draw you into her story. Regarded by many to be the &#8220;greatest American woman novelist of her day,&#8221; Edna Ferber would go on to win the Pulitzer Prize in a 1925 for her book So Big, and is also the author of Showboat and Cimarron, which along with other of her later works were successfully adapted for stage and screen.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Paul writes on behalf of Philemon&#8217;s slave, Onesimus. Beyond that, it is not self-evident as to what has transpired. Onesimus is described as having been &#8217;separated&#8217; from Philemon, once having been &#8216;useless&#8217; to him (a pun on Onesimus&#8217; name, which means &#8216;useful&#8217;), and having done him wrong. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

T. S. Eliot called it &#8216;the first, the longest, and the best of modern English detective novels&#8217;. It contains a number of ideas which became common tropes of the genre: a large number of suspects, red herrings, a crime being investigated by talented amateurs who happen to be present when it is committed, and two police officers who exemplify respectively the &#8216;local bungler&#8217; and the skilled, professional, Scotland Yard detective.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

These stories are fantastical and although aimed squarely at the flexible mind of a child which can assimilate much stranger concepts than an adult they are quite dark and occasionally brutal. The stakes can be quite high as in Rumpelstiltskin where a terrible bargain is made without due regard to possible future consequences and Tom Thumb who seems forever about to be imprisoned or sliced in two.\n\nThese are moral tales and this selection features some of the less &#8216;grim&#8217; of those tales but they are still a 1000 times more exciting and vivid than many more modern fairy tales.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Lady Susan by Jane Austen (Epistolary fiction, Romance, Satire, Teen/Young adult, Humor)\n\nJane Austen demonstrated her mastery of the epistolary novel genre in Lady Susan, which she wrote in 1795 but never published. Although the primary focus of this short novel is the selfish behavior of Lady Susan as she engages in affairs and searches for suitable husbands for herself and her young daughter, the actual action shares its importance with Austen&#8217;s manipulation of her characters&#8217; behavior by means of their reactions to the letters that they receive. The heroine adds additional interest by altering the tone of her own letters based on the recipient of the letter. Thus, the character of Lady Susan is developed through many branches as Austen suggests complications of identity and the way in which that identity is based on interaction rather than on solitary constructions of personality. Lady Susan&#8217;s character is also built by the descriptions of the other letter-writers; but even though their opinions of this heroine coincide with the image that develops from her own letters, Austen demonstrates the subjectivity of the opinions by presenting them &#8211; primarily &#8211; in the letters of one woman to another, thereby suggesting the established literary motifs of feminine gossip and jealousy. Readers recognize these subjective motifs and examine all of the idiosyncrasies of the characters in order to create their own opinion of Lady Susan &#8211; as they would of any real acquaintance\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
