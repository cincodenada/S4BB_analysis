         "description" : "The Way We Live Now by Anthony Trollope (Satire)\n\nThe Way We Live Now is a scathing satirical novel published in London in 1875 by Anthony Trollope, after a popular serialization. It was regarded by many of Trollope&#8217;s contemporaries as his finest work.\n\nOne of his longest novels (it contains a hundred chapters), The Way We Live Now is particularly rich in sub-plot. It was inspired by the financial scandals of the early 1870s, and lashes at the pervading dishonesty of the age, commercial, political, moral, and intellectual. It is one of the last memorable Victorian novels to have been published in monthly parts.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Canyons of the Colorado by John Wesley Powell (History, Science, Travel, Nature, Memoirs)\n\nJohn Wesley Powell was a pioneer American explorer, ethnologist, and geologist in the 19th Century. In 1869 he set out to explore the Colorado and the Grand Canyon. He gathered nine men, four boats and food for ten months and set out from Green River, Wyoming, on May 24. Passing through dangerous rapids, the group passed down the Green River to its confluence with the Colorado River (then also known as the Grand River upriver from the junction), near present-day Moab, Utah.\n\nThe expedition&#8217;s route traveled through the Utah canyons of the Colorado River, which Powell described in his published diary as having &#8230;wonderful features&#8212;carved walls, royal arches, glens, alcove gulches, mounds and monuments. From which of these features shall we select a name? We decide to call it Glen Canyon. (Ironically, now almost completely submerged by Lake Powell, behind the Glen Canyon Dam.)\n\nOne man (Goodman) quit after the first month and another three (Dunn and the Howland brothers) left at Separation Rapid in the third, only two days before the group reached the mouth of the Virgin River on August 30 after traversing almost 1,500 km. The three who left the group late in the trip were later killed&#8212;probably by Indians.\n\nPowell retraced the route in 1871-1872 with another expedition, producing photographs, an accurate map, and various papers, including ethnographic reports of the area&#8217;s Native Americans and a monograph on their languages. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Zwanzigtausend Meilen unter&#226;&#128;&#153;m Meer by Jules Verne (Adventure, Sea stories)\n\n20.000 Meilen unter dem Meer ist ein Roman des franz&#195;&#182;sischen Schriftstellers Jules Verne. Der Roman ist vorgeblich ein Erlebnisbericht des franz&#195;&#182;sischen Professors Pierre Aronnax, Autor eines Werkes &#195;&#188;ber &#226;&#128;&#158;Die Geheimnisse der Meerestiefen&#226;&#128;&#156;. Auf einer Expedition zur Kl&#195;&#164;rung einer Reihe r&#195;&#164;tselhafter Schiffsungl&#195;&#188;cke, die von einem Unterwasserfahrzeug oder Seeungeheuer gekentert worden sein sollen, wird das fragliche Objekt gesichtet. Im Verlauf der anschlie&#195;&#159;enden Verfolgungsjag werden Aronnax, sein Diener Conseil und der kanadische Harpunier Ned Land ins offene Meer gesp&#195;&#188;lt, finden aber letztlich auf der Oberfl&#195;&#164;che des vermeintlichen Seeungeheuers festen Boden unter den F&#195;&#188;&#195;&#159;en. Es stellt sich heraus, dass es sich tats&#195;&#164;chlich um ein eisenbeschlagenes Unterseeboot handelt. Nach einiger Zeit &#195;&#182;ffnet sich eine Luke und die drei M&#195;&#164;nner werden von Mannschaftsangeh&#195;&#182;rigen des Gef&#195;&#164;hrts in eine Zelle gef&#195;&#188;hrt, sp&#195;&#164;ter dem Kapit&#195;&#164;n vorgef&#195;&#188;hrt, der sich dann als &#226;&#128;&#158;Nemo&#226;&#128;&#156; &#226;&#136;&#146; lateinisch f&#195;&#188;r &#226;&#128;&#158;Niemand&#226;&#128;&#156; &#226;&#128;&#147; vorstellt. \nMit der Zeit erf&#195;&#164;hrt Aronnax in Gespr&#195;&#164;chen mit dem mysteri&#195;&#182;sen Nemo Details &#195;&#188;ber die technischen F&#195;&#164;higkeiten des Unterseeboots, der Nautilus, jedoch kaum etwas &#195;&#188;ber ihren Kapit&#195;&#164;n und ihre Mannschaft. Die drei Gestrandeten sind gezwungen, an Bord der Nautilus eine Weltreise unter Wasser mitzumachen, und erleben allerlei Abenteuer; sie k&#195;&#164;mpfen gegen einen Riesenkraken und einen Hai, sehen die Ruinen des versunkenen Atlantis und sind an Bord, als Kapit&#195;&#164;n Nemo mit seiner Nautilus als erster Mensch den S&#195;&#188;dpol erreicht. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The First Battle of Bull Run by Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard (History)\n\nGeneral Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard was one of the senior commanders of Southern forces during the Civil War. It was he who initiated the hostilities by opening fire on Ft. Sumter in Charleston harbor, in April, 1861.\n\nIn July of that year, having taken command of the Confederate Army of the Potomac, he triumphed in the first serious clash of the war, at Manassas, Virginia. His army, aided by reinforcements from Johnston&#8217;s army in the Shenandoah Valley, routed a Federal army under General McDowell. Had it been his army instead that routed, it is possible the Civil War might have ended that same year, as the path to Richmond would have been wide open.\n\nThis is his account of the battle, including the strategic situation leading up to it. As an afterward, he added a very revealing appraisal of the relations between him and Confederate President Jefferson Davis, and the reasons why, in his opinion, the South failed to win its war of secession. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

It offers both detailed argumentation and passionate eloquence in opposition to the social and legal inequalities commonly imposed upon women by a patriarchal culture. Just as in &#8220;On Liberty,&#8221; Mill defends the emancipation of women on utilitarian grounds, convinced that the moral and intellectual advancement of women would result in greater happiness for everybody.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Temperance Gems by William McGonagall (Poetry)\n\nGood people all, of every degree,\nI pray, ye all be warned by me:\nI advise ye all to pause and think,\nAnd never more to taste strong drink.\n\nSome people do say it is good when taken in moderation,\nBut, when taken to excess, it leads to tribulation,\nAlso to starvation and loss of reputation,\nLikewise your eternal soul&#8217;s damnation.\n\nMcGonagall has been widely acclaimed as the worst poet in British history. He campaigned vigorously against excessive drinking, appearing in pubs and bars to give edifying poems and speeches. These were very popular, the people of Dundee possibly recognising that McGonagall was &#8220;so giftedly bad he backed unwittingly into genius&#8221;. Six of those poems are recited here.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
