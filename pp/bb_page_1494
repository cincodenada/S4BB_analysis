At seventeen years of age, he began writing for the Paducah Daily News, his hometown paper. At nineteen he became the managing editor; up to that point, our nation&#8217;s youngest. He worked as a columnist, a humorist and an author. But &#8216;horror,&#8217; and &#8217;short stories,&#8217; are not why he is remembered. He is remembered because he was, and still is, funny.

Romeo and Juliet meet at a party and fall instantly in love, realizing too late that their families, the Montagues and the Capulets, are mortal enemies. Braving parental opposition, the teenage lovers marry in secret, with the aid of the well-intentioned Friar Lawrence. Yet, as Shakespeare has often observed, the course of true love does not run smoothly, and Romeo and Juliet must risk death to be together.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Allan Quatermain by H. Rider Haggard ( Adventure )\n\nAllan Quatermain was the quintessential Victorian English gentleman cum African big-game hunter. In this book, the second in the series, Quaterman and his two good friends from KSM have tired of their dull and unfulfilling lives in England, and decide to search for the truth of an old tale about the existence of an isolated white kingdom deep in darkest Africa. Their journey and subsequent adventures are sure to satisfy those who enjoy tales of dangerous quests and heroic just-in-time derring-do.\n\nAllan Quatermain appears in some 15 to 18 stories or books by H. Rider Haggard. (The number varies by source and apparently depends on how one chooses to count the shorter stories.) Haggard suggests that Quatermain was the author of the works, and he (Haggard) only edited and published them. The most famous Quatermain book is the first, King Solomon&#8217;s Mines (1885), and the sequel (1887) was Allan Quatermain &#8211; in which the main character, shall we say, departs for a better place! All the other Quatermain books &#8211; even those whose events occurred earlier in time &#8211; seem to have been written after these two main titles.\n\nThe internal chronology of Quatermain&#8217;s life is a big mess, to be honest. As you study the research and learn of the numerous contradictions of timing of events in the books, you see that conjecture and invention are required to create any kind of internal chronology that makes sense. So my advice is to read (listen to) the books for enjoyment, don&#8217;t take notes!, and don&#8217;t worry about how one event simply can&#8217;t be possible on the apparent date because it conflicts wtih some other event in a different story! Hey! It&#8217;s fiction &#8211; anything goes!

         "description" : "The Portrait of a Lady, Volume 1 by Henry James ( Literature )\n\nThe Portrait of a Lady is a novel by Henry James, first published as a serial in The Atlantic Monthly and Macmillan&#8217;s Magazine in 1880-1881 and then as a book in 1881. It is the story of a spirited young American woman, Isabel Archer, who &#8220;affronts her destiny&#8221; and finds it overwhelming. She inherits a large amount of money and subsequently becomes the victim of Machiavellian scheming by two American expatriates. Like many of James&#8217;s novels, it is set mostly in Europe, notably England and Italy.\n\nGenerally regarded as the masterpiece of his early phase of writing, this novel reflects James&#8217;s absorbing interest in the differences between the New World and the Old. It also treats in a profound way the themes of personal freedom, responsibility, betrayal, and sexuality.

The story follows Captain Stormfield on his extremely long cosmic journey to heaven, his accidental misplacement, his short-lived interest in singing and playing the harp, and the obsession of souls with the &#8220;celebrities&#8221; of heaven, like Adam and Moses, whom, according to Twain, become as distant to most people in heaven as living celebrities are on Earth. Twain uses this story to show his view that the common conception of heaven is ludicrous and points out the incongruities of such beliefs.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Politics by Aristotle (Philosophy, Politics)\n\nThe Politics, by the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle, is one of the most influential texts in political philosophy. In it, Aristotle explores the role that the political community should play in developing the virtue of its citizens. One of his central ideas is that &#8220;Man is a political animal,&#8221; meaning that people can only become virtuous by active participation in the political community. Aristotle also criticizes his teacher Plato, classifies and evaluates six different types of constitutions and political institutions, and describes his vision of the ideal state. Aristotle&#8217;s views on women and slavery are unenlightened by today&#8217;s standards, but his work remains enduring and relevant to this day.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
