         "description" : "The Ego and His Own by Max Stirner (Philosophy)\n\nIn this book, his most famous, Max Stirner presents a philosophical case for a radical egoism that shuns the socially-oriented outlooks of both &quot;establishment&quot; ideologies and of revolutionaries in favor of an extreme individualism. The book is most widely talked about today only through the lens of other philosophers&apos; thought: Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels launched a famous assault on it in The German Ideology, and some draw a connection between Stirner&apos;s thoughts here and Nietzsche&apos;s egoism a generation later. But it is worth reading in its own right, as much for its lyricism as the challenge of its philosophical proposals.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Mill on the Floss by George Eliot (Fiction, Literature)\n\nThe novel details the lives of Tom and Maggie Tulliver, a brother and sister growing up on the river Floss near the village of St. Oggs, evidently in the 1820&#8217;s, after the Napoleonic Wars but prior to the first Reform Bill (1832). The novel spans a period of 10-15 years, from Tom and Maggie&#8217;s childhood up until their deaths in a flood on the Floss. The book is fictional autobiography in part, reflecting the disgrace that George Eliot (Mary Ann Evans) herself had while in a lengthy relationship with a married man, George Henry Lewes.\nMaggie Tulliver holds the central role in the book, as both her relationship with her older brother Tom, and her romantic relationships with Philip Wakem, a hunchbacked, but sensitive and intellectual, friend, and with Stephen Guest, a vivacious young socialite in St. Oggs and fiance of Maggie&#8217;s cousin Lucy Deane, constitute the most significant narrative threads: \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Story of a Common Soldier of Army Life in the Civil War, 1861-1865 by Leander Stillwell (Biography, History, Memoirs, War stories)\n\nLeander Stillwell was an 18-year-old Illinois farm boy, living with his family in a log cabin, when the U.S. Civil War broke out. Stillwell felt a duty &#8220;to help save the Nation;&#8221; but, as with many other young men, his Patriotism was tinged with bravura: &#8220;the idea of staying at home and turning over senseless clods on the farm with the cannon thundering so close at hand . . . was simply intolerable.&#8221; Stillwell volunteered for the 61st Illinois Infantry in January 1861. His youthful enthusiasm for the soldier&#8217;s life was soon tempered at Shiloh, where he first &#8220;saw a gun fired in anger,&#8221; and &#8220;saw a man die a violent death.&#8221;\n\nStillwell&#8217;s recounting of events is always vivid, personal, and engrossing. &#8220;I distinctly remember my first shot at Shiloh . . . The fronts of both lines were . . . shrouded in smoke. I had my gun at a ready, and was trying to peer under the smoke in order to get a sight of our enemies. Suddenly I heard someone in a highly excited tone calling to me from just in my rear, &#8211;&#8217;Stillwell! Shoot! Shoot! Why don&#8217;t you shoot?&#8217; I looked around and saw that this command was being given by . . . our second lieutenant, who was wild with excitement, jumping up and down like a hen on a hot griddle. &#8216;Why, lieutenant,&#8217; I said, &#8216;I can&#8217;t see anything to shoot at.&#8217; &#8216;Shoot, shoot, anyhow!&#8217; &#8216;All right,&#8217; I responded. . . And bringing my gun to my shoulder, I aimed low in the direction of the enemy, and blazed away through the smoke. But at the time the idea to me was ridiculous that one should blindly shoot into a cloud of smoke without having a bead on the object to be shot at.&#8221;\n\nThe Story of a Common Soldier is a compelling coming of age tale that will appeal not only to Civil War buffs but to anyone who enjoys autobiographies. Written at the urging of his youngest son, when Stillwell was a mature man&#8211;a lawyer, judge, and member of the Kansas legislature, it combines graphic detail (provided by his war diary and letters written at the time to his family) with the insights of a thoughtful man looking back on those horrific times.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

His brief encounter with deadly gunplay has ignited a deep urging to repeat the adrenaline rush but is tempered by ghosts that haunt his sleep. He only dares to release his inner demon when he is taking down an outlaw who is particularly known for his brutality.\n\nHe develops a reputation for killing the most notorious Texas outlaws, which draws an unexpected interest: a captain of the Texas Rangers offers him a pardon and a ranger&#8217;s badge if he will infiltrate the gang of the shadowy figure known as &#8220;Cheseldine&#8221; who wields vast power in West Texas, and make it possible for the Rangers to break the gang&#8217;s hold on the region&#8217;s towns. Duane accepts, never guessing in his wildest nightmares that he would sniff out this Cheseldine, his hideouts, his lieutenants&#8230; and fall in love with his daughter!\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Famous Men of the Middle Ages by John H. Haaren and A. B. Poland (Biography, Children, History)\n\n&#8220;THE study of history, like the study of a landscape, should begin with the most conspicuous features. Not until these have been fixed in memory will the lesser features fall into their appropriate places and assume their right proportions.\n\nThe famous men of ancient and modern times are the mountain peaks of history. It is logical then that the study of history should begin with the biographies of these men.\n\nNot only is it logical; it is also pedagogical.

         "description" : "Moths of the Limberlost by Gene Stratton-Porter (Nature, Science)\n\nGene Stratton-Porter was an American author, amateur naturalist, wildlife photographer, specializing in the birds and moths in one of the last of the vanishing wetlands of the lower Great Lakes Basin. The Limberlost and Wildflower Woods of northeastern Indiana were the laboratory and inspiration for her stories, novels, essays, photography, and movies. She was an accomplished author, artist and photographer and is generally considered to be one of the first female authors to promulgate public positions; conserving the Limberlost Swamp in her case.\n\nAlthough Stratton-Porter wanted to focus on nature books, it was her romantic novels that made her famous and generated the finances that allowed her to pursue her nature studies. In Moths of the Limberlost, she shares her lifelong love of the moths through a series of charming anecdotes and wonderfully descriptive passages, providing vivid detail of each stage of their life cycles.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Englishwoman in America by Isabella Lucy Bird (Travel)\n\nIsabella Bird travels abroad in Canada and the United States in the 1850s. As an Englishwoman and a lone female, she travels as far as Chicago, Prince Edward Island, and Cincinatti. Her observations on the trials and tribulations of the journeys are astute, if formed by her place and time in history. Adventures with pickpockets, omnibuses, cholera, and rat infested hotels deter her not. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Letters from England, 1846-1849 by Elizabeth Davis Bancroft (Travel)\n\nElizabeth Bancroft went to England with her husband, historian George Bancroft, for three of the most dynamicy years in European hstory. As Ambassador to England from the United States, George moved in the highest circles. In his wife&#8217;s letters to their sons, her uncle, her brother, and Mrs. Polk (the President&#8217;s wife), we see glimpses not only of early Victorian English life, but also of Queen Victoria herself! Mrs. Bancroft speaks of dinners with Benjamin Disraeli, visits to Wordsworth, weekends in the country with Louis Napolean and Sir Robert Peel with such matter of fact aplomb that one cannot help being impressed. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Age of Reason by Thomas Paine (Politics, Religion, Philosophy)\n\nThe Age of Reason: Being an Investigation of True and Fabulous Theology, a deistic treatise written by eighteenth-century British radical and American revolutionary Thomas Paine, critiques institutionalized religion and challenges the inerrancy of the Bible. Published in three parts in 1794, 1795, and 1807, it was a bestseller in America, where it caused a short-lived deistic revival. British audiences, however, fearing increased political radicalism as a result of the French revolution, received it with more hostility.\n\nThe Age of Reason presents common deistic arguments. For example, it highlights the corruption of the Christian Church and criticizes its efforts to acquire political power. Paine advocates reason in the place of revelation, leading him to reject miracles and to view the Bible as an ordinary piece of literature rather than as a divinely-inspired text. Yet, The Age of Reason is not atheistic: it promotes natural religion and argues for a creator-God.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
