The translation was made by Robert Young, compiler of Young&#226;&#128;&#153;s Analytical Concordance to the Bible and Concise Critical Comments on the New Testament. Young produced a &#226;&#128;&#156;Revised Version&#226;&#128;&#157; of the translation in 1887. After he died on October 14, 1888, the publisher in 1898 released a new Revised Edition.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Tom Swift and his Electric Runabout by Victor Appleton (Teen/Young adult, Adventure)\n\nTom Swift enters an upcoming race with his specially-designed prototype electric race car. But as he makes the final preparations and adjustments, days before the race, he discovers a plot that would bankrupt not only his family, but also everyone else that relies on the local bank (which is the target of a nefarious bank-run scheme). Tom must solve the mystery and stop the criminals behind the plot before he&#8217;ll test himself on a 500 mile race against some of the best electric cars and skilled drivers in the United States. Listeners are forewarned that some elements and characters included in Tom Swift books portray certain ethnic groups in a very dated manner that modern readers, and listeners, may find offensive. Despite the racially stereotyped behavior and pronunciation in the books, the Reader believes it makes sense to read what&#8217;s written in order to be faithful to the author&#8217;s intent.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Serviss, is one of the many science fiction novels published in the nineteenth century. Although science fiction was not at the time thought of as a distinct literary genre, it was a very popular literary form, with almost every fiction magazine regularly publishing science fiction stories and novels. &#8220;Edison&#8217;s Conquest of Mars&#8221; was published in 1898 as an unauthorized sequel to H. G. Wells&#8217;s The War of the Worlds, but did not achieve the fame of its predecessor. The book was endorsed by Thomas Edison, the hero of the book &#8212; though not by Wells.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

It begins with a queer and rich old woman found stabbed to death in her chair and not a clue to the murderer. Then so many clues turn up that even the story-book detective is bewildered.

         "description" : "An Introduction to Metaphysics by Henri Bergson (Philosophy)\n\nAn Introduction to Metaphysics (Introduction a la Metaphysique) is a 1903 essay by Henri Bergson that explores the concept of reality. For Bergson, reality occurs not in a series of discrete states but as a process similar to that described by the Greek philosopher Heraclitus. Reality is fluid and cannot be completely understood through reductionistic analysis, which he said &#8220;implies that we go around an object&#8221;, gaining knowledge from various perspectives which are relative. Instead, reality can be grasped absolutely only through intuition, which Bergson expressed as &#8220;entering into&#8221; the object. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Janifer) (Science fiction, spy stories)\n\n&#8220;Mark Phillips&#8221; is, or are, two writers: Randall Garrett and Laurence M. Janifer. Their joint pen-name, derived from their middle names (Philip and Mark), was coined soon after their original meeting, at a science-fiction convention. Both men were drunk at the time, which explains a good deal, and only one has ever sobered up. A matter for constant contention between the collaborators is which one.\n\nOriginally published as That Sweet Little Old Lady, Brain Twister follows the adventures of FBI agent Kenneth J. Malone as he attempts to unravel the machinations of a telepathic spy. His first problem: how do you find a telepath to catch the first telepath?\n\nThe novella was nominated for the Hugo Award in 1960. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Unterwegs begegnet er Olivo, dem Gatten einer ehemaligen Geliebten. Da Casanova Olivo einst zu viel Geld verholfen hat, l&#195;&#164;dt dieser ihn dankbar zu sich auf sein Landgut. Dort trifft Casanova nicht nur seine ehemalige Geliebte wieder, sondern auch eine bet&#195;&#182;rende junge Sch&#195;&#182;nheit namens Marcolina, die gleich in ihm die alte Leidenschaft erweckt. Casanova bietet dem durchs Kartenspiel hochverschuldeten Liebhaber der Marcolina, Leutnant Lorenzi, viel Geld, um unerkannt und verkleidet eine Nacht bei Marcolina verbringen zu d&#195;&#188;rfen &#226;&#128;&#148; Lorenzi willigt ein, nimmt das Geld und gibt Casanova im Tausch seinen Mantel. Mit diesem bekleidet begibt sich Casanova nach Einbruch der Dunkelheit auf das Zimmer Marcolinas, um noch einmal seine alte Leidenschaft zu entfesseln. Als am n&#195;&#164;chsten Morgen die ersten Sonnenstrahlen durch das Fenster fallen, erkennt Marcolina, mit wem sie die Nacht verbracht hat.

Als Handlungsort hat Ernst Constantin die damals noch unerforschte Polarregion gew&#228;hlt. Sicherlich mit ein Grund, warum der Roman heute in Vergessenheit geraten ist.",
