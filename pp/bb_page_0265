Marco&#8217;s father, Stefan, is a Samavian patriot working to overthrow the cruel dictatorship in the kingdom of Samavia. Marco and his father, Stefan, come to London where Marco strikes up a friendship with a crippled street urchin known as The Rat. Marco&#8217;s father, realizing that two boys are less likely to be noticed, entrusts them with a secret mission to travel across Europe giving the secret sign: &#8216;The Lamp is lighted.&#8217; This brings about a revolution which succeeds in overthrowing the old regime and re-establishing the rightful king. The book ends in a climatic scene as Marco realizes his father is the descendant of Ivor Fedorovitch and thus the rightful king of Samavia. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Wells, addressing ideas of society and community, human nature and identity, religion, Darwinism, and eugenics.\n\nWhen the novel was written in the late 19th century, England&#8217;s scientific community was engulfed by debates on animal vivisection. Interest groups were even formed to tackle the issue: the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection was formed two years after the publication of the novel. The novel is presented as a discovered manuscript, introduced by the narrator&#8217;s nephew; it then &#8216;transcribes&#8217; the tale. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Don Juan: Canto I by Byron, George Gordon, Lord (Poetry)\n\nDon Juan is a long narrative poem by Byron, based very loosely on the legend of the evil seducer, Don Juan. The first and second of (eventually) seventeen Cantos composed during Byron&#8217;s self-imposed exile from England appeared, anonymously, in July 1819 and were greeted with scandal, condemnation, admiration and hilarity. Modern critics generally consider the self-proclaimed &#8216;epic&#8217;, which remained incomplete at Byron&#8217;s death, to be his masterpiece.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

It is usually described as one of Tolstoy&#8217;s two major masterpieces (the other being Anna Karenina) as well as one of the world&#8217;s greatest novels.\n\nWar and Peace offered a new kind of fiction, with a great many characters caught up in a plot that covered nothing less than the grand subjects indicated by the title, combined with the equally large topics of youth, age and marriage. While today it is considered a novel, it broke so many novelistic conventions of its day that many critics of Tolstoy&#8217;s time did not consider it as such. Tolstoy himself considered Anna Karenina (1878) to be his first attempt at a novel in the European sense. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders by Daniel Defoe (Romance)\n\nThe Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders is a 1722 novel by Daniel Defoe.\nDefoe wrote this after his work as a journalist and pamphleteer. By 1722, Defoe had become recognized as a novelist, with the success of Robinson Crusoe in 1719. His political work was tapering off at this point, due to the fall of both Whig and Tory party leaders with whom he had been associated; Robert Walpole was beginning his rise, and Defoe was never fully at home with the Walpole group.\nDefoe&#8217;s Whig views are nevertheless evident in the story of Moll. The full title of the novel tells part of its story: &#8220;The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders, Etc. Who was born in Newgate, and during a life of continu&#8217;d Variety for Threescore Years, besides her Childhood, was Twelve Year a Whore, five times a Wife (whereof once to her own brother), Twelve Year a Thief, Eight Year a Transported Felon in Virginia, at last grew Rich, liv&#8217;d Honest and died a Penitent. Written from her own Memorandums.&#8221;\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Henry&#8217;s birth name is William Sydney Porter; however, he adopted the pen name O. Henry while in prison. He published 10 collections and over 600 short stories during his lifetime.\n\nThe Trimmed Lamp follows The Four Million and provides another series of short stories that take place in New York City in the early years of the 20th century and are representative of the surprise endings that popularized O. Henry&#8217;s work. They also capture his use of coincidence or chance to create humor in the story. O Henry wrote about ordinary people in everyday circumstances. He is quoted as once saying, &#8220;There are stories in everything. I&#8217;ve got some of my best yarns from park benches, lampposts and newspaper stands.&#8221;\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Tale of Peter Mink by Arthur Scott Bailey (Children, Fiction, Animals, Adventure)\n\nArthur Scott Bailey (1877 &#8211; 1949) was author of more than forty children&#8217;s books. Bailey&#8217;s writing has been described thusly by the Newark Evening News: &#8220;Mr. Bailey centered all his plots in the animal, bird and insect worlds, weaving natural history into the stories in a way that won educator&#8217;s approval without arousing the suspicions of his young readers. He made it a habit to never &#8216;write down&#8217; to children and frequently used words beyond the average juvenile vocabulary, believing that youngsters respond to the stimulus of the unfamiliar.&#8221;\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

The foremost Elizabethan tragedian before William Shakespeare, he is known for his magnificent blank verse, his overreaching protagonists, and his own untimely death.\n\nThe Jew of Malta (1589) is an original story of religious conflict, intrigue, and revenge, set against a backdrop of the struggle for supremacy between Spain and the Ottoman Empire in the Mediterranean. The Jew of Malta is considered to have been a major influence on William Shakespeare&#8217;s The Merchant of Venice.\n\nThe play contains a prologue in which the character Machiavel, a Senecan ghost based on Niccol&#242; Machiavelli, introduces &#8220;the tragedy of a Jew.&#8221; (summary by Wikipedia)\n\nThomas Heywood: The well-known dramatist of the time has included Prologues and Epilogues both for the court and the Cock-Pit theatre &#8220;&#8230;making choice of you unto whom to devote it;&#8221; .\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "A Shropshire Lad by A.E. Housman (Poetry)\n\nA Shropshire Lad is a cycle of sixty-three poems by the English poet Alfred Edward Housman. A Shropshire Lad was first published in 1896 at Housman&#8217;s own expense after several publishers had turned it down. At first the book sold slowly, but during the Second Boer War, Housman&#8217;s nostalgic depiction of rural life and young men&#8217;s early deaths struck a chord with English readers and the book became a bestseller. Later, World War I further increased its popularity.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
