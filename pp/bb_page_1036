         "description" : "War and Peace, Book 02: 1805 by Leo Tolstoy. (War stories, Romance)\nTranslated by Louise Shanks Maude and Aylmer Maude.\n\nWar and Peace (Russian: &#1042;&#1086;&#1081;&#1085;&#1072; &#1080; &#1084;&#1080;&#1088;, Voyna i mir; in original orthography: &#1042;&#1086;&#1081;&#1085;&#1072; &#1080; &#1084;&#1080;&#1088;&#1098;, Voyna i mir&#8221;) is an epic novel by Leo Tolstoy, first published from 1865 to 1869 in Russki Vestnik, which tells the story of Russian society during the Napoleonic Era. It is usually described as one of Tolstoy&#8217;s two major masterpieces (the other being Anna Karenina) as well as one of the world&#8217;s greatest novels.\n\nWar and Peace offered a new kind of fiction, with a great many characters caught up in a plot that covered nothing less than the grand subjects indicated by the title, combined with the equally large topics of youth, age and marriage. While today it is considered a novel, it broke so many novelistic conventions of its day that many critics of Tolstoy&#8217;s time did not consider it as such. Tolstoy himself considered Anna Karenina (1878) to be his first attempt at a novel in the European sense.\n\nNote: The novel is split up in 15 books. This is the recording of book two, which covers events in the year 1805.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

The book&#8217;s full title is On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life. It introduced the theory that populations evolve over the course of generations through a process of natural selection. It was controversial because it contradicted religious beliefs which underlay the then current theories of biology. Darwin&#8217;s book was the culmination of evidence he had accumulated on the voyage of the Beagle in the 1830s and added to through continuing investigations and experiments since his return.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Romans by American Standard Version (Religion)\n\nThe Epistle to the Romans is one of the letters of the New Testament canon of the Christian Bible. In the words of N.T. Wright, the Book of Romans is &#8220;neither a systematic theology nor a summary of Paul&#8217;s lifework, but it is by common consent his masterpiece. It dwarfs most of his other writings, an Alpine peak towering over hills and villages. Not all onlookers have viewed it in the same light or from the same angle, and their snapshots and paintings of it are sometimes remarkably unalike. Not all climbers have taken the same route up its sheer sides, and there is frequent disagreement on the best approach. What nobody doubts is that we are here dealing with a work of massive substance, presenting a formidable intellectual challenge while offering a breathtaking theological and spiritual vision.&#8221; \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

We are now in 1920, about twenty years since Irene married Young Jolyon and gave birth to John and since Soames married Annette, who gave him a daughter, Fleur. The two sides of the family have not met since those times and John and Fleur do not even know of each other&#8217;s existence.\n\nAll the old Forsytes are dead except for Timothy. Val and Holly have returned from South Africa and Val is training racehorses in Sussex. June has opened her gallery near Cork Street.\n\nSoames arranges to meet Fleur at June&#8217;s gallery and while there, and again later in a patisserie, they see Irene and John. Soames ignores them but Fleur and John are attracted to one another at a distance.

So he was just the man to be chosen king of the fairies&#8230;&#8221;\n\nGeorge MacDonald (December 10, 1824 &#8211; September 18, 1905) was a Scottish author, poet, and Christian minister. Though no longer well known, his works (particularly his fairy tales and fantasy novels) have inspired admiration in such notables as W. H. Auden, J. R. R. Tolkien, and Madeleine L&#8217;Engle. The Shadows is one such fairy tale. The strange Shadows spend their existence casting themselves upon the walls and forming pictures of various sorts: mimicking evil actions of those who have done wrong in the hopes of causing their repentance, playing a comic dumb-show to inspire a playwright and dancing to inspire a musician, nudging a little girl to comfort her grandfather, and playing with a sick little boy as he waits for his mother to return home. For all that their forms are black, their hearts are of the whitest. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Green Odyssey by Philip Jose Farmer (Science Fiction)\n\nAlan Green is a space traveler stranded on a barbaric planet who has been taken slave and made a consort to an insipid and smelly queen. His slave-wife, though beautiful and smart, nags him constantly. He&#8217;s given up hope of ever returning to Earth when he hears of two astronauts who have been captured in a kingdom on the other side of the planet, and sets out on an action-packed journey on a ship sailing across vast grasslands on rolling pin-like wheels in a desperate scheme to save them and return home.

         "description" : "A Dialogue between a Methodist and a Churchman by William Law (Religion)\n\nWilliam Law (1686-1761) was an Anglican priest, Christian mystic, and one of the most prominent, popular, and controversial theological writers of his time. Law revolutionized the way in which 18th century Anglicans engaged the spiritual aspect of their faith, and his popularity rivaled that of John and Charles Wesley. Law adapted mystical practices from early church writings to the practice and doctrine of the modern British church, with the intention of equipping the Anglican layman to pursue intimacy with Christ.\n\nA Dialogue Between a Methodist and a Churchman is one of Law&#8217;s purely theological works. In it, Law engages what he sees as the most dangerous doctrines of Methodism using a dialectic format. The dialogue focuses especially on the Calvinistic doctrines of predestination and absolute depravity, and is remarkable for its extrapolation of Calvinist proof texts to refute the doctrines they allegedly prove.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Essays of Francis Bacon by Francis Bacon (Essay/Short nonfiction)\n\nVoltaire was an atheist. Diderot was Enlightened. But trite titles seldom encompass completely the beliefs of any individual. And this one fact is certainly true when dealing with Sir Francis Bacon.\n\nThe youngest son of Sir Nicholas Bacon, Francis was born in Strand, London, on Jan. 22, 1561. He went to Trinity College at Cambridge. He was elected to Parliament; he was Queen&#8217;s Counsel; he even became Attorney General before finally gaining the position of Lord Chancellor.\n\n\nBut as do the careers of so many politicians, in 1621 his political career ended in disgrace.\n\n\nAnd yet, for all of this, both Diderot and Voltaire considered him &#8220;the father of modern science.&#8221; Others consider him only the father of the &#8220;scientific method.&#8221; (That process of collecting and organizing data.) Bacon&#8217;s &#8220;The Essays,&#8221; to which we now turn our attention, are&#8211;if they are nothing else&#8211;a delightful collection in decided disarray. That is, they seem to take no true progression. But an essay is not meant to be a treatise. And for all that, these essays are still a pleasure to read.\n\n\nEncompassing a broad field of interest, their largesse denotes the broad learning of this brilliant philosopher. It is therefore our sincere hope that the reader will, themselves, encompass these Essays. More importantly, we hope you enjoy them.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

As the play opens, King Henry IV (formerly Henry Bolingbroke) and Henry Percy (Hotspur) argue over the disposition of prisoners from the Battle of Holmedon. The King&#8217;s attitude toward Mortimer and the Percy family prompts them to plot rebellion. In the meantime, his son Prince Hal is living the low life in the company of Sir John Falstaff. As the time of battle nears, Prince Hal joins his father and is given a high command. The play&#8217;s climax is the Battle of Shrewsbury, in which Prince Hal and Hotspur meet and fight, with Prince Hal and the forces of the King prevailing. The action continues in King Henry IV, Part 2. From the start this has been an extremely popular play both with the public and with critics. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Mysteries of Udolpho by Ann Radcliffe (Horror/Ghost stories, Literature, Fiction)\n\nConsidered a change agent in early Gothic romance; oft-referenced in later literary works or paid homage to by such authors as Jane Austen (influential novel ready by her heroine, Catherine Morland, in Northanger Abbey); Edgar Allen Poe (borrowed plot elements for the short story The Oval Portrait); and Sir Walter Scott.\n\nIn The Mysteries of Udolpho, one of the most famous and popular gothic novels of the eighteenth century, Ann Radcliffe took a new tack from her predecessors and portrayed her heroine&#8217;s inner life, creating an atmosphere thick with fear, and providing a gripping plot that continues to thrill readers today. &#8211; The Mysteries of Udolpho, set in Europe in the year 1584, is the story of orphan Emily St. Aubert, who finds herself separated from the man she loves and confined within the medieval castle of her aunt&#8217;s new husband, Montoni, after being forced to travel through France and Italy. Inside the castle, she must cope with an unwanted suitor, Montoni&#8217;s threats, and the wild imaginings and terrors that threaten to overwhelm her.\n\nThe mysterious happenings in the story always have a natural and probable explanation because Radcliffe was a very rational person and did not believe in the supernatural. Radcliffe&#8217;s strengths in writing were in describing scenery as well as suspense and terror. Many critics have called the work &#8220;dreamlike&#8221; and &#8220;suggestive of the cinematic technique of slow-motion.&#8221;\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Age of Innocence by Edith Wharton (Poetry)\n\nIn an era before the advent of electric lights, telephones or motor vehicles, there exists a small cluster of aristocratic &#8220;old revolutionary stock&#8221; families that rule New York&#8217;s social life. Under the rules of this society, &#8220;being things&#8221; is better than &#8220;doing things&#8221; and reputation and outward appearances come at the exclusion of everything else. In this Gilded Age, when America&#8217;s expansion and increased industrialism produce a group of newly wealthy robber barons and financiers, the patient, time-honored values of the old ruling class, and century, are giving way to the expediencies of the new. Caught at this cusp, a triangle of lovers, who must choose between the expectations of family and society, and the deepest yearnings of the heart.\nNewly engaged couple, Newland Archer, a young lawyer, and May Welland, a society debutante, are part of the old world, where the &#8220;right people&#8221; follow the &#8220;correct rules&#8221; and marry into &#8220;acceptable families.&#8221; The arrival from Europe of May&#8217;s cousin, the Countess Ellen Olenska, complicates their union, as Ellen&#8217;s mysterious past threatens to cast a shadow of scandal over the newly betrothed couple. Newland Archer, at first critical of Ellen&#8217;s bohemian lifestyle, and her seemingly wilful ignorance of the rules and customs of his Old New York, is soon captivated by Ellen&#8217;s warmth, spirit, and her generous and loving heart. Will he cast off the life for which he&#8217;s been groomed, or sacrifice happiness for duty and the greater good of the social order?\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
