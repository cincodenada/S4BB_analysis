         "description" : "The Odyssey by Homer (Literature)\n\nThe Odyssey is one of the two major ancient Greek epic poems (the other being the Iliad), attributed to the poet Homer. The poem is commonly dated to between 800 and 600 BC. The poem is, in part, a sequel to the Iliad, and concerns the events that befall the Greek hero Odysseus in his long journey back to his native land Ithaca after the fall of Troy.\n\nIt takes Odysseus ten years to return to his native land of Ithaca after ten years of war; during his 20-year absence, his son Telemachus and his wife Penelope must deal with a group of unruly suitors who have moved into Odysseus&#8217; home to compete for Penelope&#8217;s hand in marriage, since most have assumed that Odysseus has died.\n\nThe poem is a fundamental text in the Western canon and continues to be read in both Homeric Greek and translations around the world.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners by John Bunyan (Biography, Religion)\n\nGrace Abounding is the spiritual autobiography of John Bunyan, who also penned Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress, perhaps one of the most significant pieces of Christian literature, second only to the Bible. Grace Abounding follows Bunyan&#8217;s struggle to find true repentance and forgiveness, his battle with Satan&#8217;s temptations of unbelief, his comfort found in the Bible and his overarching victory gotten by the grace of God through Jesus Christ his Son. Readers familiar with Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress will recognize that many of the allegorical points in his famous work came out of Bunyan&#8217;s own struggles and discoveries, and it has been said that Bunyan could not have written Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress without first going through the battles chronicled in Grace Abounding. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Peter Pan (version 2) by J. M. Barrie (Fantasy, Children, Adventure)\n\nIn both the play and the novel, Peter often visits the &#8220;real world&#8221; of London to listen in on bedtime stories told by Mary Darling to her children. One night, Peter is spotted, and while trying to escape, he loses his shadow. On returning to claim his shadow, he wakes Mary&#8217;s daughter, Wendy Darling. When Wendy succeeds in re-attaching his shadow to him, Peter takes a fancy to her and invites her to Neverland to be a mother to his gang of Lost Boys, the children who are lost in Kensington Gardens. Wendy agrees, and her brothers John and Michael go along. The dangerous and magical flight to Neverland is followed by many adventures. The children are blown out of air by a cannon and Wendy is nearly killed. Peter and the Lost Boys build a little house for Wendy to live in while she recuperates. Soon John and Michael adopt the ways of the Lost Boys, while Wendy plays house in mothering them, all the while invoking the jealousy of Tinker Bell, Tiger Lily, and the mermaids. Peter is often oblivious, concentrating on real and make-believe adventures and on taunting the pirate Captain Hook. Later follows adventures at Mermaids&#8217; Lagoon, the near deaths of Tinker Bell and Peter; a violent pirate/Indian massacre, and a climactic confrontation with Peter&#8217;s nemesis, the pirate Captain Hook of the pirate ship the Jolly Roger.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Three of them are presented here, of which The Signal Man is one of the best known. Though quite different from his most celebrated realistic and humorous critical novels, these ghost stories, Gothic and grotesque as they are, are of good portrayal, and worth a read/listen. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "A Short History of England by G. K. Chesterton (History, Essay)\n\nGilbert Keith Chesterton was a prolific writer on many topics. His views of history were always from the standpoint of men and their interactions, and it may fairly be said he saw all of history as a battle between civilization and barbarism. So it has always been, and that remains true even today.\n\n&#8220;But it is especially in the matter of the Middle Ages that the popular histories trample upon the popular traditions. In this respect there is an almost comic contrast between the general information provided about England in the last two or three centuries, in which its present industrial system was being built up, and the general information given about the preceding centuries, which we call broadly mediaeval. &#8220;\n\nAs this quotation taken from the Introduction clearly shows, he is no mere pedant reciting dry dates and locations, but a profound thinker flooding new light onto those modern &#8220;myths&#8221; that have filled our historys. He is a master of paradox, and the techique of reducing his opponents arguments to the logical absurdity they have inherent in them. He often turns them upside down. All of which makes his work both a sound subject for reflection and highly entertaining all the while it remains permanently timely. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
