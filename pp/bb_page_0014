The text used is the first version in the Gutenberg collection. &#8211; Magna Carta is the most significant early influence on the long historical process that has led to the rule of constitutional law today. Magna Carta was originally created because of disagreements between the Pope, King John and his English barons over the rights of the King. Magna Carta required the king to renounce certain rights and respect certain legal procedures and to accept that the will of the king could be bound by law.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
