         "description" : "The Adventures of Huckelberry Finn by Mark Twain (Adventure)\n\nAdventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884) by Mark Twain is one of the truly great American novels, beloved by children, adults, and literary critics alike. The book tells the story of &#8220;Huck&#8221; Finn (first introduced as Tom Sawyer&#8217;s sidekick in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer), his friend Jim, and their journey down the Mississippi River on a raft. Both are on the run, Huck from his drunk and abusive father, and Jim as a runaway slave.\n\nAs Huck and Jim drift down the river, they meet many colorful characters and have many great adventures. The true heart of the story, however, is the friendship between Huck and Jim. A constant theme throughout the book is Huck&#8217;s internal struggle between what he has been taught, that helping a runaway slave is a sin, and what he truly believes, that Jim is a good man and it couldn&#8217;t possibly be wrong to help him.\n\nAdventures of Huckleberry Finn was unique at the time of its publication (1884) because it is narrated by Huck himself and is written in the numerous dialects common in the area and time in which the book is set. Although the book was originally intended as a sequel to the children&#8217;s book The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, as Twain wrote Adventures of Huckleberry Finn it progressed into a more serious work. Twain&#8217;s views on slavery and other social issues of the time become clear through the words, thoughts, and actions of Huck Finn. The book has always been the subject of great controversy, and according to The American Library Association it was fifth on the list of most frequently challenged books in the 1990s.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Struwwelpeter: Merry Tales and Funny Pictures (Children, Poetry)\n\nStruwwelpeter (Slovenly Peter) is an illustrated collection of humorous children&#8217;s poems describing ludicrous and usually violent punishments for naughty behavior. Hoffmann, a Frankfurt physician, wanted to buy a picture book for his son for Christmas in 1844. Not impressed by what the stores had to offer, he instead bought a notebook and wrote his own stories and pictures. While Struwwelpeter is somewhat notorious for its perceived brutal treatment of the erring children, it has been influential on many later children&#8217;s books, most notably Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.The source of the audio content is in the public domain.

         "description" : "Our Island Story, Part 1 by Henrietta Elizabeth Marshall (1867-1941) (Children, Essay/Short nonfiction, History)\n\nOur Island Story was first published in 1905 and became an instant classic. Beginning with the Romans and following the triumphs and foibles of the good, not so good and the downright despicable figures of history; we are treated to a dazzling montage of kings, queens, barons, knights, explorers, movers and shakers that have played a key role in the history of England. Marshall freely mixes folk tale with historical fact and in so doing paints a very vivid picture of the past in a style reminiscent of all that is finest in the children&#8217;s story telling tradition.This is the first section of that work and will carry you from the time when Tacitus first sang the praises of Britannica to his Roman readers up to the vicious and bloodthirsty confusion that is the War of the Roses (about 1500 years)\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Der Geist reitet auf seinem Schimmel lautlos in die Fluten um dort unterzugehen. Das gesamte Dorf kennt dieses Zeichen seit &#252;ber hundert Jahren. Der Erz&#228;hler aber nimmt die Gestalt w&#228;hrend eines Sturmes wahr, ohne je davor von ihr geh&#246;rt zu haben.\n\n    Da der Sturm zunimmt, sucht er Zuflucht in dem Gasthaus des Dorfes. Dort berichtet ihm der Schulmeister das Schicksal Hauke Haiens, des einstigen Deichgrafen, den sein hartes Schicksal zum &#8220;Schimmelreiter&#8221; machte. Immer wieder unterbrochen von den Geschehnissen in der Wirtsstube vermischt der Lehrer Fakten und Sage und zeigt so, wie die Legende entstand.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
