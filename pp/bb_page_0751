         "description" : "Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym by Edgar Allan Poe (Adventure)\n\nThe Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket is Edgar Allan Poe&#8217;s only complete novel, published in 1838.\nThe work relates the tale of the young Arthur Gordon Pym who stows away aboard a whaling ship called Grampus. Various adventures and mis-adventures befall Pym including shipwreck, mutiny and cannibalism. The story starts out as a fairly conventional adventure at sea, but it becomes increasingly strange and hard to classify in later chapters, involving religious symbolism and the Hollow Earth. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Benson (1867-1940) was born at Wellington College in Berkshire, where his father, who later went on to become the Archbishop of Canterbury, was the first Headmaster. He wrote 105 books in all.\n\nQueen Lucia (first published in 1920) was the first of Benson&#8217;s &#8216;Mapp and Lucia&#8217; novels of which there were six. This first book is a comedy of manners based in the provincial village of Riseholme, where Emmeline Lucas (the Queen Lucia of the title) presides over the social and artistic universe of the gullible residents. Her aide-de-camp in these matters is the somewhat effete Georgie Pillson and the chief competitor for her &#8216;crown&#8217; is Daisy Quantock. The scandal of the Guru, the psychical goings on with Princess Popoffski and the arrival into the sleepy village of a famous Prima Donna all conspire to threaten her supremacy&#8230;\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

(Literature)\n\nFyodor Dostoyevsky&#8217;s short masterpiece about a ranting, slightly mad civil servant. The stylistic inventiveness, and the insights into the absurdities and weakness of humans seem so fresh and incisive today that if published now (a century and a half later) Notes would be considered an avant-garde post-modernist triumph. In some ways this is a heavy text, laden with conversational philosophizing; but the vividness of the narrator make it a wonderful read, and funny.",

         "description" : "A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&#8217;s Court by Mark Twain (1835-1910) (Adventure, Fantasy, Satire)\n\nCome and hear the strange tail of The Boss Hank Morgan, a modern day (at the time of publication) Connecticut Yankee who inexplicably finds himself transported to the court of the legendary King Arthur (as the title of the book implies). Hank, or simply, The Boss, as he comes to be most frequently known, quickly uses his modern day knowledge and education to pass himself off as a great magician, to get himself out of all sorts of surprising, (and frequently amusing) situations, as well as to advance the technological and cultural status of the nation in which he finds himself.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

She married mathematician George Boole. She was the author of several works on teaching and teaching mathematics in particular. \nThis short book, Philosophy and Fun of Algebra, is meant to be read by children and introduces algebra and logic. She uses the word &#8220;algebra&#8221; broadly, defining it as a &#8220;method of solving problems by honest confession of one&#8217;s ignorance&#8221;. Using this definition, Boole introduces, in a conversational manner, the concepts of logic and algebra, illustrating these concepts with stories and anecdotes, often from biblical sources. At times, her discussion seems somewhat mystical, speaking of the imagination and angels as messengers which guide one toward the next step in a logical investigation. Boole ends the book with a reminder that algebra&#8217;s essential element is &#8220;the habitual registration of the exact limits of one&#8217;s knowledge&#8221; and a call for the public to keep this principle in mind when encountering any situation. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.The source of the audio content is in the public domain.

Most chapters are devoted to historical events; such as the the seventeenth century persecution of roman catholics (with many large houses having specially constructed &#8220;priests&#8217; holes&#8221;), or various unpopular monarchs and their hiding places. The text is scattered with legends and true stories, with occasional skeletons found, still hiding, long centuries after the searchers have left. The author describes hidden doors, passages, rooms and pits with enormous enthusiasm &#8230; and with considerable regret when he has to describe secret places lost to demolition or modernisation. You&#8217;ll wish you could wander the country, poking into the darkest recesses of every old house you find!\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Translated by John Veitch (1829-1894). (Philosophy)\n\nThe Discourse on Method is best known as the source of the famous quotation &#8220;cogito ergo sum&#8221;, &#8220;I think, therefore I am.&#8221; &#8230;. It is a method which gives a solid platform from which all modern natural sciences could evolve. With this work, the idea of skepticism was revived from the ancients such as Sextus Empiricus and modified to account for a truth that Descartes found to be incontrovertible. Descartes started his line of reasoning by doubting everything, so as to assess the world from a fresh perspective, clear of any preconceived notions.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.The source of the audio content is in the public domain.

         "description" : "Hamlet by William Shakespeare (Tragedy)\n\nHamlet is commonly regarded as one of the greatest plays ever written. Drawing on Danish chronicles and the Elizabethan vogue for revenge tragedy, Shakespeare created a play that is at once a philosophic treatise, a family drama, and a supernatural thriller. In the wake of his father&#8217;s death, Prince Hamlet finds that his Uncle Claudius has swiftly taken the throne and married his mother, Queen Gertrude. The ghost of the dead king then appears and charges Claudius with &#8216;murder most foul.&#8217; Hamlet is called to revenge his father&#8217;s death: but will he be able to act before it is too late?\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Man Who Knew Too Much by G. K. Chesterton (Mystery)\n\nGilbert Keith Chesterton (1874-1936) was an influential and prolific English writer of the early 20th century. He was a journalist, a poet and a novelist. He wrote 80 books and 200 short stories in addition to his other work. He is perhaps best remembered for his &#8216;Father Brown&#8217; stories. \n\n&#8216;The Man Who Knew Too Much&#8217; has some similarities to the Father Brown stories: Horne Fisher the eponymous hero is connected and indeed related to many of the high-ranking politicians of his age and thus &#8216;knows too much&#8217; about the background of the mysteries in which he becomes embroiled and which he unravels.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Prince and the Pauper by Mark Twain (Children)\n\nThe Prince and the Pauper (1882) represents Mark Twain&#8217;s first attempt at historical fiction. The book, set in 1547, tells the story of two young boys who are identical in appearance: Tom Canty, a pauper who lives with his abusive father in Offal Court, London, and Prince Edward son of Henry VIII of England. Due to a series of circumstances, the boys accidentally replace each other, and much of the humor in the book originates in the two boys&#8217; inability to function in the world that is so familiar to the other (although Tom soon displays considerable wisdom in his decisions). In many ways, the book is a social satire, particularly compelling in its condemnation of the inequality that existed between the classes in Tudor England. In that sense, Twain abandoned the wry Midwestern style for which he was best known and adopts a style reminiscent of Charles Dickens.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

The collection originally comprised thirty-four love poems, but two further poems were added before publication (&#8221;All day I hear the noise of waters&#8221; and &#8220;I hear an army charging upon the land&#8221;).\n\nAlthough the poems did not sell well, they received some critical acclaim. Ezra Pound admired the &#8220;delicate temperament&#8221; of these early poems, while Yeats described &#8220;I hear an army charging upon the land&#8221; as &#8220;a technical and emotional masterpiece&#8221;. In 1909, Joyce wrote to his wife, &#8220;When I wrote Chamber Music, I was a lonely boy, walking about by myself at night and thinking that one day a girl would love me.&#8221;\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
