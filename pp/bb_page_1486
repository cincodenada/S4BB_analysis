         "description" : "The Advance of Science in the Last Half-Century by T. H. Huxley (Science)\n\nThomas H. Huxley, an English biologist and essayist, was an advocate of the theory of evolution and a self-proclaimed agnostic. A talented writer, his essays helped to popularize science in the 19th century, and he is credited with the quote, &#8220;Try to learn something about everything and everything about something.&#8221; In The Advance of Science in the Last Half Century, he presents a summary of the major developments in Physics, Chemistry and Biology during the period 1839-1889 and their impact on society, within the historical context of philosophical thought and scientific inquiry going back to Aristotle. Huxley&#8217;s clear and readable prose makes this subject equally enjoyable for both the student of scientific history and the casual listener alike. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Not a direct translation and deemed modern in its time, Lamb states in the preface that, &#8220;I have gained a rapidity to the narration which I hope will make it more attractive and give it more the air of a romance to young readers&#8221;. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

It would be years before &#8220;Johnson&#8217;s Dictionary&#8221;, as it came to be known, would ever turn a profit; authors&#8217; royalities being unknown at that time, Johnson, once his contract to deliver the book was fulfilled, received no further monies connected to the book.\n\nJohnson, once again a freelance writer, albeit now a famous one, faced a grim hand-to-mouth existence; however, in July 1762 the twenty-four year old King George III granted Johnson an annual pension of &#163;300. While not making Johnson rich, it allowed him a modest yet comfortable independence for the remaining thirty years of his life.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

She produced this volume based on Daniel Defoe&#8217;s most famous work, considered by many to be the first English novel (1719). She also rendered Bunyan&#8217;s Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress and Wyss&#8217; Swiss Family Robinson, which she translated as well.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

He personally rebuilt an 11.2 metre sloop-rigged fishing boat that he named the Spray. On April 24, 1895, he set sail from Boston, Massachusetts. More than three years later, he returned to Newport, Rhode Island, on June 27, 1898 having circumnavigated the world, a distance of 46,000 miles (74,000 km).\n\nIn 1899 he described the voyage in Sailing Alone Around the World now considered a classic of travel literature. It is a wonderful adventure story from the Age of Sail and a book of which Arthur Ransome declared, &#8220;boys who do not like this book ought to be drowned at once.&#8221;\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Life and Adventures of Martin Chuzzlewit by Charles Dickens (Satire)\n\nOld Martin Chuzzlewit has heaps of money that has never brought him anything but misery. Estranged from his grandson and namesake, when word gets out that he is ill, he finds himself surrounded by a throng of relatives that he despises, all hoping to get a piece of the pie. He allows himself to be taken under the wing of his obsequious and hypocritical cousin, Seth Pecksniff, who is more than happy to shelter him and kowtow to him and to keep all other relatives away. Will this vulture be the one to inherit the old man&#8217;s fortune, or is there more going on than meets the eye?\n\nTreachery, mayhem, and possibly murder, along with some genuine love and compassion are skillfully intertwined in this book, along with Dickens&#8217; classic wit and brilliantly created characters. His villains are odious, his good guys are delightful, and those that fall in between truly deserve to be called &#8220;Characters.&#8221;\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Selected Poems of Emily Dickinson by  E. Dickinson (Poetry)\n\nEmily Dickinson has come to be regarded as one of the quintessential poets of 19th century America. A very private poet with a very quiet and reclusive life, her poetry was published posthumously and immediately found a wide audience.\n\nWhile she echoed the romantic natural themes of her times, her style was much more free and irregular, causing many to criticize her and editors to &#8220;correct&#8221; her. In the early 20th century, when poetic style had become much looser, new audiences learned to appreciate her work. Here collected are many of her most contemplative, most rebellious, and &#8220;dark&#8221; works, expressing her frustrations with the behavioral confines of her times, and the confines of being human and unknowing of eternity.\n\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "White People, The by Arthur Machen (Horror, Ghost Stories)\n\nLiterary critics see Arthur Machen&#8217;s works as a significant part of the late Victorian revival of the gothic novel and the decadent movement of the 1890s, bearing direct comparison to the themes found in contemporary works like Robert Louis Stevenson&#8217;s The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, Bram Stoker&#8217;s Dracula, and Oscar Wilde&#8217;s The Picture of Dorian Gray. The White People is a highly influential horror story of a young girl&#8217;s discovery of ancient magic. It was written in the late 1890s as part of a longer unfinished novel, some sketches from which went into his book Ornaments in Jade. Fans of supernatural fiction often cite this story as a classic in the genre. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Anti-Federalist Papers by Patrick Henry (Philosophy, Essay/Short nonfiction, Politics)\n\nDuring the period of debate over the ratification of the Constitution, numerous independent local speeches and articles were published all across the country. Initially, many of the articles in opposition were written under pseudonyms, such as &#8220;Brutus&#8221;, &#8220;Centinel&#8221;, and &#8220;Federal Farmer&#8221;. Eventually, famous revolutionary figures such as Patrick Henry came out publicly against the Constitution. They argued that the strong national government proposed by the Federalists was a threat to the rights of individuals and that the President would become a king. They objected to the federal court system created by the proposed constitution. This produced a phenomenal body of political writing; the best and most influential of these articles and speeches were gathered by historians into a collection known as the Anti-Federalist Papers in allusion to the Federalist Papers.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Bible (WEB) NT 10: Ephesians (Religion)\n\nPaul writes to the church at Ephesus, beginning with a praise to God for the forgiveness of their sins and for choosing them in His grace. Paul prays for the spiritual well-being of the Ephesians and reminds them how sinful they were before they turned to Christ. He then speaks of his revelation, by which he was selected to preach to the Gentiles, for they can also be saved. Among other things, he urges the Ephesians to be humble, to avoid sexual immorality and foul speech, and to be united in Christ even though they are diverse in spiritual talents. He also gives advice to husbands and wives, children and fathers, and servants and masters. The letter concludes with an extended metaphor of the Christian as spiritual warrior. \n\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
