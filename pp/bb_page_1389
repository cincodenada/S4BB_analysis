         "description" : "Ranald Bannerman&#8217;s Boyhood by George MacDonald (Autobiography)\n\nGeorge MacDonald is mainly known for his fantasy works and fairy tales such as At the Back of the North Wind and The Princess and the Goblin (version 1) (version 2). However, during his life he was more famous for many more realistic novels. . . among them the somewhat autobiographical Ranald Bannerman&#8217;s Boyhood.\n\nThis story of a young motherless boy growing up with his brothers in a Scottish manse is full of delightful characters. There is Kirsty, an enchanting Highland storyteller, Turkey, the intrepid cowherd, the evil Kelpie, and the lovely Elsie Duff. Throughout the twists and turns of his escapades and adventures Ranald learns from his father the important lessons of courage and integrity.\n\nWhen Ranald Bannerman&#8217;s Boyhood came out in 1871 the New York Independent praised it as &#8220;full of sweetness, full of boy-life and true goodness&#8221;. Perhaps, but it is also a good story, from the master of storytellers.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "A Vindication of the Rights of Woman by Mary Wollstonecraft (Philosophy)\n\nWollstonecraft (1759-1797) is best known for A Vindication of the Rights of Woman in which she argued that women are not naturally inferior to men, but only appeared to be because they lacked education. She suggested that both men and women should be treated as rational beings and imagined a social order founded on reason.\nToday, Wollstonecraft is considered a foundational thinker in feminist philosophy. Her early advocacy of women&#8217;s equality and her attacks on conventional femininity and the degradation of women presaged the later emergence of the feminist political movement. Feminist scholars and activists have cited both her philosophical ideas and personal struggles as important influences in their work.\nThis is one of the 12 Books That Changed the World by Melvyn Bragg.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Consolation of Philosophy by Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius (Philosophy)\n\nConsolation of Philosophy (Latin: Consolatio Philosophiae) is a philosophical work by Boethius written in about the year 524 AD. It has been described as the single most important and influential work in the West in medieval and early Renaissance Christianity, and is also the last great work that can be called Classical.\n\nConsolation of Philosophy was written during Boethius&#8217; one year imprisonment while awaiting trial, and eventual horrific execution, for the crime of treason by Ostrogothic King Theodoric the Great. Boethius was at the very heights of power in Rome and was brought down by treachery. It was from this experience he was inspired to write a philosophical book from prison reflecting on how a lord&#8217;s favor could change so quickly and why friends would turn against him. It has been described as &#8216;by far the most interesting example of prison literature the world has ever seen.&#8217;\n\nThe Consolation of Philosophy stands, by its note of fatalism and its affinities with the Christian doctrine of humility, midway between the heathen philosophy of Seneca the Younger and the later Christian philosophy of consolation represented by Thomas Aquinas. &#8211; The book is heavily influenced by Plato and his dialogues (as was Boethius himself).\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

He was a man who seemed to know everything about human nature and as Orson Welles said &#8216;he speaks to everyone and we all claim him&#8217;. I know that it has been said that &#8216;it is impossible to be a great Shakespearian actor without an idiosyncratic and extraordinary voice&#8217; and this may be so, but that does not preclude ordinary mortals from reading, hearing and enjoying Shakespeare. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

He and his traveling companion Sora departed from Edo (modern-day Tokyo) for the northerly interior region known as Oku, propelled mostly by a desire to see the places about which the old poets wrote. Travel in those days was, of course, very dangerous to one&#8217;s health, but Bash&#333; was committed to a kind of poetic ideal of wandering. He travelled for about 156 days all together, covering thousands of miles mostly on foot. Of all of Bash&#333;&#8217;s works, Oku no Hosomichi is best known.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "On the Antiseptic Principle of the Practice of Surgery by Joseph Lister (1827-1912) (Essay/Short non-fiction)\n\nJoseph Lister was born near London in 1827. He studied medicine at the University of London and pursued a career as a surgeon in Scotland. He became professor of Surgery in Glasgow and later (1877) at Kings College Hospital, in London.\n\nLister&#8217;s contribution to the advancement of surgery cannot be overestimated. Before his work on antisepsis, wounds were often left open to heal, leading to long recoveries, unsightly scarring, and not infrequently amputation or death due to infection. Lister&#8217;s work enabled more wounds to be closed primarily with sutures, drastically reducing healing time, scarring, amputations, and deaths due to infection.\n\nLister retired in 1896 but was called back to assist in the operation on King Edward VII for appendicitis just days before the King&#8217;s coronation. The King later credited Lister for his survival and quick recovery. Lister died in 1912. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

The lectures were not intended for the specialist, more to urge a wider and more systematic study of China and its culture, and to encourage new students into the field.\n\nWhile many of the observations are just as relevant today, others will remind us how much China has changed since the period of the Manchu Qing dynasty in which he wrote.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

It is to this fact, that any little history there is of the Norse Kings and their old tragedies, crimes and heroisms, is almost all due. The Icelanders, it seems, not only made beautiful letters on their paper or parchment, but were laudably observant and desirous of accuracy; and have left us such a collection of narratives (Sagas, literally &#8220;Says&#8221;) as, for quantity and quality, is unexampled among rude nations. Snorro Sturleson&#8217;s History of the Norse Kings is built out of these old Sagas; and has in it a great deal of poetic fire,. . . and deserves to be reckoned among the great history-books of the world. It is from these sources that the following rough notes of the early Norway Kings are hastily thrown together.&#8221;\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Freckles by Gene Stratton-Porter (Nature, Fiction)\n\nFreckles is a young man who has been raised since infancy in a Chicago orphanage. His one dream is to find a job, a place to belong and people who accept him despite his youth and the disability of having only one hand. He finds this place in the Limberlost Swamp, as Mr. McLean&#8217;s Limberlost guard of precious timber.\n\nIn the process, he discovers a love for the wilderness and animals he encounters every day on his rounds and a burning desire to learn about all the new birds and plants he sees on his rounds every day. He also finds and falls in love with a girl he calls the &#8220;Swamp Angel.&#8221; This is the story of his plucky courage in sticking to his job in the swamp, and his adventures in learning about the natural world he finds himself in every day. He is befriended by the &#8220;Bird Woman&#8221; and with her help learns to love the Limberlost he has been hired to guard.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
