         "description" : "A Modest Proposal by Jonathan Swift (1667-1745) (Essay/Short nonfiction)\n\n    Jonathan Swift almost defines satire in this biting and brutal pamphlet in which he suggests that poor (Catholic) Irish families should fatten up their children and sell them to the rich (Protestant) land owners, thus solving the twin problems of starving children and poverty in one blow. When the &#8220;Proposal&#8221; was published in 1729, Swift was quickly attacked, and even accused of barbarity &#8211; the exact state the &#8220;Proposal&#8221; was written to expose.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Der Roman ist aus einer radikal subjektiven Perspektive geschrieben: er besteht nur aus Briefen von Werther vor allem an einen Freund namens Wilhelm. Erst im letzten Teil des zweiten Buches tritt ein Erz&#228;hler hinzu. Anhand der Briefe kann der Leser sowohl dem Verlauf der Handlung als auch den Gef&#252;hlen Werthers folgen, der immer verzweifelter wird, bis es schlie&#223;lich in einer Katastrophe endet.\n    Der Roman besteht aus zwei B&#252;chern, die aber eher als zwei Teile eines einzigen Romans anzusehen sind.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Gerrard Street Mystery and Other Weird Tales by John Charles Dent  (1841-1888) (Horror/Ghost stories, Mystery, Short stories)\n\nJohn Charles Dent, the author of the following remarkable stories, was born in Kendal, Westmorland, England, in 1841. His parents emigrated to Canada shortly after that event, bringing with them, of course, the youth who was afterwards to become the Canadian author and historian. Mr. Dent received his primary education in Canadian schools, and afterwards studied law, becoming in due course a member of the Upper Canada Bar. He only practised for a few years, then returned to England to pursue a literary career, writing mostly for periodicals. After remaining in England for several years, Mr. Dent and his family moved to Boston, in America, for about two years. But he finally returned to Canada, accepting a journalistic position in Toronto. Mr. Dent proceeded to write &#8216;The Canadian Portrait Gallery&#8217;, which ran to four large volumes, &#8216;The Last Forty Years: Canada since the Union of 1841&#8242;, and a &#8216;History of the Rebellion in Upper Canada&#8217;.\nThis collected work of his short fiction, contributed by their author at considerable intervals to different periodicals, was published posthumously. The stories themselves are delightfully anchored in the physical geography of Upper Canada (or in the case of &#8216;Gagtooth&#8217;s Image&#8217;, Illinois), and have a mystical and spooky air about them.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

The author of this book is unknown but is considered by many biblical scholars to be Solomon.\n\nThe author describes how all endeavors in life are in vain and a grasping for the wind, since all comes to naught in the end when we return to the dust from whence we came. The generations to come will not remember us. In the end, The Preacher admonishes us that the only purpose for man is to eat, drink and perform his labors under the sun and to do it with happiness and devotion to God.\n\nThis reading comes from the American Standard Version (ASV) of The Holy Bible. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.The source of the audio content is in the public domain.

         "description" : "The Riot Act by the British Parliament (Essay)\n\nThe Riot Act was passed by the British Parliament in 1714, the first year of the reign of George I, and came into effect in August 1715. This was a time of widespread social disturbance, as the preamble describes; the Act sought to put an end to this. A group of twelve or more people, &#8220;being unlawfully, riotously and tumultuously assembled&#8221;, would be read a proclamation; they must disperse within an hour, on pain of death. The same fate would befall anyone preventing the reading of the proclamation, or damaging buildings while on a riot. If the law enforcement officers happened to injure or kill a rioter, they were immune from prosecution. The reading of the proclamation, the wording of which is detailed in the Act, was the necessary first step before action could be taken against the rioters. This gave us the phrase &#8220;to read the riot act&#8221;, to give a stern warning or rebuke. The Act was repealed in Britain in 1973, but had long since fallen into disuse there. A version is still in force in Canada.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Three Musketeers by Alexandre Dumas (Adventure)\n\nThe Three Musketeers (Les Trois Mousquetaires) is a novel by Alexandre Dumas, p&#232;re. It recounts the adventures of a young man named d&#8217;Artagnan after he leaves home to become a musketeer. D&#8217;Artagnan is not one of the musketeers of the title; those are his friends Athos, Porthos, and Aramis &#8212; inseparable friends who live by the motto, &#8220;One for all, and all for one&#8221;.\n\nThe Three Musketeers was first published in serial form in the magazine Le Si&#232;cle between March and July 1844. Dumas claimed it was based on manuscripts he had discovered in the Biblioth&#232;que Nationale. It was later proven that Dumas had based his work on the book M&#233;moires de Monsieur D&#8217;Artagnan, capitaine lieutenant de la premi&#232;re compagnie des Mousquetaires du Roi (Memoirs of Mister D&#8217;Artagnan, Lieutenant Captain of the first company of the King&#8217;s Musketeers) by Gatien de Courtilz de Sandras (Cologne, 1700).\n\nDumas&#8217; version of the story covers the adventures of D&#8217;Artagnan and his friends from 1625 to 1628, as they are involved in intrigues involving the weak King Louis XIII of France, his powerful and cunning advisor Cardinal Richelieu, the beautiful Queen Anne of Austria, her English lover, George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, and the Siege of La Rochelle. Adding to the intrigue are the mysterious Milady de Winter, and Richelieu&#8217;s right-hand man, the Comte de Rochefort.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Iliad by Homer (Tragedy)\n\nThe Iliad, together with the Odyssey, is one of two ancient Greek epic poems traditionally attributed to Homer. The poem is commonly dated to the 8th or 7th century BC, and many scholars believe it is the oldest extant work of literature in the Greek language, making it the first work of European literature. The existence of a single author for the poems is disputed as the poems themselves show evidence of a long oral tradition and hence, multiple authors. The poem concerns events during the tenth and final year in the siege of the city of Iliun, or Troy, by the Greeks.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

The plot involves the uncovering of secret German preparations for an invasion of the United Kingdom. It is often called the first modern spy novel, although others are as well, it was certainly very influential in the genre and for its time.\n\nThe book enjoyed immense popularity in the years before World War I and was extremely influential. Winston Churchill later credited it as a major reason that the Admiralty decided to establish naval bases at Invergordon, the Firth of Forth and Scapa Flow.",
