Hoffmann \n\nDas skurrile M&#228;rchen &#8222;Meister Floh&#8220; erz&#228;hlt die Geschichte des frauenscheuen Tr&#228;umers Peregrinus Ty&#223; und dessen Begegnung mit dem weisen und gelehrten Meister der Fl&#246;he. Am Weihnachtsabend bringt Peregrinus den Kindern eines armen Buchbinders Geschenke und trifft dort die sch&#246;ne und geheimnisvolle D&#246;rtje Elverdink, die ihn bittet, sie in sein Haus aufzunehmen. Dort besteht sie auf der Herausgabe eines Gefangenen, von dem Peregrinus allerdings gar nichts wei&#223;. \nZur selben Zeit gastiert ein Flohb&#228;ndiger und Mikroskopist in der Stadt, dem zun&#228;chst seine Fl&#246;he und dann seine sch&#246;ne Nichte D&#246;rtje abhanden gekommen sind. Auch Georg Pepusch, eine Freud des Peregrinus Ty&#223;, ist auf der Suche nach D&#246;rtje, die er f&#252;r die wieder zum Leben erweckte Prinzessin Gamaheh aus Famagusta h&#228;lt. \nPeregrinus macht die Bekanntschaft des Meister Flohs, der lange ein Gefangener des Flohb&#228;ndigers war und Peregrinus nun um Schutz bittet. Die sch&#246;ne D&#246;rtje, die tats&#228;chlich die Prinzessin Gamaheh ist, d&#252;rfe ihn um keinen Preis in ihre Gewalt bekommen, da sonst das ganze Volk der Fl&#246;he wieder zur Sklaverei verurteilt sei. Obwohl Peregrinus von D&#246;rtje bezaubert ist, verspricht er, dem Meister Floh zu helfen. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Tess of the d&#8217;Urbervilles by Thomas Hardy (Fiction, Literature)\n\nOne of the greatest English tragic novels, TESS OF THE D&#8217;URBERVILLES (1891) is the story of a &#8220;pure woman&#8221; who is victimized both by conventional morality and its antithesis. Born near Dorchester, Thomas Hardy (1840-1928) set most of his stories in the region between Berkshire and Dorset in the fictional county of Wessex. He was a controversial writer whose work often showed the result of flouting the rigid Victorian moral code &#8212; his novel JUDE THE OBSCURE was (allegedly) burned by the Bishop of Wakefield for its shocking content. Hardy was an unflinching observer and in TESS has left us some unforgettable vignettes of rural life in late 19th-century England: the slow death of a flock of wounded pheasants, the monotony of field labour under an iron gray sky, and the itinerant farm worker&#8217;s seasonal round.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "First Epistle of Clement to the Corinthians by Pope Clement I\n\n&#8220;First Clement is one of the oldest Christian documents outside the New Testament canon (ca. 96 A.D.). The epistle was written by Clement, one of the elders of the church of Rome, to the church in Corinth, where it was read for centuries. The purpose of the writing was to exhort the Corinthians to reinstate its elders after they had been overthrown by other brethren. Historians generally hold First Clement to be an authentic document dating from the first century. From the fifth century to the eighth century, many of the eastern churches accepted the First Epistle of Clement as canonical scripture as it is clearly listed among the canonical books of the New Testament in &#8220;Canon 85&#8243; of the Canons of the Apostles. However, by the end of the eighth century, none of the ancient churches, eastern or western, included First Clement in any official listing of the canonical New Testament&#8221; \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "John Barleycorn or Alcoholic Memoirs by Jack London (Memoirs, Biography)\n\nJack London died at the age of forty. In this autobiographical work, London describes his life as seen through the eyes of John Barleycorn (alcohol). There is much controversy about the cause of his death just as there is about alcoholism and addiction. London&#8217;s brutally frank and honest analysis of his own struggles and bouts with alcohol was way before its time and more modern theories of addiction. With remarkable candor and insight, London describes the demons and gods he encountered through both friend and enemy, John Barleycorn. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Reflections on War and Death by Sigmund Freud ( Politics, Psychology, Philosophy )\n\nAnyone, as Freud tells us in Reflections on War and Death, forced to react against his own impulses may be described as a hypocrite, whether he is conscious of it or not. One might even venture to assert&#8212;it is still Freud&#8217;s argument&#8212;that our contemporary civilisation favours this sort of hypocrisy and that there are more civilised hypocrites than truly cultured persons, and it is even a question whether a certain amount of hypocrisy is not indispensable to maintain civilisation. When this travesty of civilisation, this infallible state that has regimented and dragooned its citizens into obedience, goes to war, Freud is pained but not surprised that it makes free use of every injustice, of every act of violence that would dishonour the individual, that it employs not only permissible cunning but conscious lies and intentional deception against the enemy, that it absolves itself from guarantees and treaties by which it was bound to other states and makes unabashed confession of its greed and aspiration to power. For conscience, the idea of right and wrong, in the Freudian sense, is not the inexorable judge that teachers of ethics say it is: it has its origin in nothing but &#8220;social fear,&#8221; and whereas in times of peace the state forbids the individual to do wrong, not because it wishes to do away with wrongdoing but because it wishes to monopolise it, like salt or tobacco, it suspends its reproach in times of war. The suppression of evil desires also ceases, and men, finding the moral ties loosened between large human units, commit acts of cruelty, treachery, deception and brutality the very possibility of which would have been considered incompatible with their degree of culture.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Anhand zweier Charaktere mit unterschiedlichen philosophischen Grunds&#228;tzen, wobei einer der beiden sein Alter Ego darstellt, illustriert er das Wesen sowohl des individualistischen Anarchismus&#8216; als auch des Kommunismus&#8216; seiner Zeit.\nAuban, Mackays Alter Ego, wird nicht nur mit den Widrigkeiten in einer Bewegung, die sich zwar anarchistisch nennt, aber mit seinen individualistischen Grunds&#228;tzen nicht konform geht, sondern auch mit der zunehmenden Entfremdung seines Freundes Trupp gegen&#252;ber, der ein gl&#252;hender Anh&#228;nger der kommunistischen Arbeiterbewegung ist, konfrontiert.\nObschon ein philosophisches Buch, liest sich &#8222;Die Anarchisten&#8220; stellenweise wie ein Roman, was nicht nur der konfliktreichen Situation, sondern auch der sprachlichen F&#228;higkeiten Mackays geschuldet ist.\nFerner hatte dieses Werk einen nicht zu verachtenden Einflu&#223; auf die europ&#228;ische Arbeiterbewegung, der bis dato Mackays Gedanken, die &#252;berwiegend der individualanarchistischen Bewegung in Amerika entsprangen, ausgesprochen fremd war. So wurde das Buch nach seiner Ver&#246;ffentlichung 1891 reichlich rezipiert und, &#252;berwiegend in den sozialistischen Kreisen, diskutiert.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Am Pol finden sie eine Station der Bewohner des Mars, die sich selbst Nume nennen. Von hier aus erforschen sie die Erde, die sie Ba nennen, und deren Bewohner, die Bate.\nDer Ballon verungl&#252;ckt, Saltner und Grunthe werden von den Numen gerettet, doch Thorms Schicksal ist ungewiss, man bef&#252;rchtet, dass er den Absturz nicht &#252;berlebt hat.\nDie beiden Geretteten werden von den Marsbewohnern gastfreundlich in deren Station aufgenommen. Sie erleben die Nume als sehr menschen&#228;hnliche Wesen mit weit &#252;berlegener Technik. Um sich gegenseitig besser kennen zu lernen, wird Saltner auf den Mars gebracht.\nUnterdessen trifft ein Luftschiff der Nume auf ein englisches Kriegsschiff und wird von diesem beschossen. Die Nume beschlie&#223;en daraufhin die Unterwerfung der Erde und ihrer primitiven Bewohner.\n\nDer Roman &#8220;Auf zwei Planeten&#8221; (1897) mit seinen &#252;ber 1.000 Seiten geh&#246;rt zu den wichtigsten deutschen Science-Fiction-Romanen, der auch in zahlreiche Sprachen &#252;bersetzt und mehrmals neu aufgelegt wurde. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "What I Believe by Leo Tolstoy\n\t\t\n&quot;The inner working of my soul, which I wish to speak of here, was not the result of a methodical investigation of doctrinal theology, or of the actual texts of the gospel; it was a sudden removal of all that hid the true meaning of the Christian doctrine &#8211; a momentary flash of light, which made everything clear to me. It was something like that which might happen to a man who, after vainly attempting, by a false plan, to build up a statue out of a confused heap of small pieces of marble, suddenly guesses at the figure they are intended to form by the shape of the largest piece; and then, on beginning to set up the statue, finds his guess confirmed by the harmonious joining in of the various pieces.&quot; (Extract from Chapter 1)\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Old Mother West Wind by Thornton W. Burgess\n\t\t\nThornton Waldo Burgess (January 14, 1874 &#8211; June 5, 1965) was a conservationist and author of children&#8217;s stories. He loved the beauty of nature and its living creatures so much that he wrote about them for 50 years. By the time he retired, he had written more than 170 books. Many of his outdoor observations in nature were used as plots for his stories. In his first book, &#8220;Old Mother West Wind,&#8221; published in 1910, the reader meets many of the characters found in later books and stories. These characters include Peter Rabbit, Jimmy Skunk, Sammy Jay, Bobby Raccoon, Joe Otter, Grandfather Frog, Billy Mink, Jerry Muskrat, Spotty the Turtle and of course, Old Mother West Wind and her Merry Little Breezes. Note to parents of very small children: in Chapter 15, little Tommy Trout gets eaten by a pickerel.\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
