         "description" : "Army Life in a Black Regiment by Thomas Wentworth Higginson (History, War stories)\n\nThese pages record some of the adventures of the First South Carolina Volunteers, the first slave regiment mustered into the service of the United States during the late civil war. It was, indeed, the first colored regiment of any kind so mustered, except a portion of the troops raised by Major-General Butler at New Orleans. These scarcely belonged to the same class, however, being recruited from the free colored population of that city, a comparatively self-reliant and educated race. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Astrophil and Stella by Sir Philip Sidney (Poetry)\n\nAstrophil and Stella is a sonnet sequence written by Philip Sidney, an Elizabethan poet and courtier. It details the frustrated love of Astrophil (whose name means &#8220;star-lover&#8221;) for his beloved Stella (whose name means &#8220;star&#8221;). It is likely that Sidney based his poems on his own unrequited passion for a married woman. The sequence inspired other sonnet writers of the period, such as Edmund Spenser, William Shakespeare, and Lady Mary Wroth.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Peterkin Papers (version 2) by Lucretia P. Hale (Children)\n\nThe Peterkin Papers is a book-length collection of humorous stories by Lucretia Peabody Hale, and is her best-known work. The Peterkins are a lovable but comically inept family with ingenuity, logic, resourcefulness, and energy&#8212;but not common sense. Many chapters show the family trying to solve some problem in a roundabout way, failing, and eventually being rescued by &#8220;the wise old lady from Philadelphia,&#8221; who cuts the Gordian knot with an effective but prosaic solution. The charm of the story is not in the plot, but in the telling, building up layers of complication, and the affectionate fun poked at the not-quite-cartoonish characters. The &#8220;wise old lady&#8217;s&#8221; solution is usually obvious to the reader, even the young listener, from the start. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

The discovery of two small bite marks on Flora&#8217;s neck leads Mr Marchdale, an old friend of the family, to the conclusion that she was bitten by a vampire. While Flora recovers, her brother Henry and Mr Marchdale begin their hunt for the vampire. Their suspicions soon fall on the mysterious Sir Francis Varney, who has just bought an old abbey near Bannersworth Hall, and who bears an uncanny resemblance to Marmaduke Bannersworth, a long-dead ancestor of the family.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Sali&#243; a la venta en enero de 1605 con numerosas erratas, a causa de la celeridad que impon&#237;a el contrato de edici&#243;n. Esta edici&#243;n se reimprimi&#243; en el mismo a&#241;o y en el mismo taller, de forma que hay en realidad dos ediciones de 1605 ligeramente distintas.

His descriptions of &#8220;surf-riding&#8221;, which he dubbed a &#8220;royal sport&#8221;, helped introduce it to and popularize it with the mainland. London writes:\n\nThrough the white crest of a breaker suddenly appears a dark figure, erect, a man-fish or a sea-god, on the very forward face of the crest where the top falls over and down, driving in toward shore, buried to his loins in smoking spray, caught up by the sea and flung landward, bodily, a quarter of a mile. It is a Kanaka on a surf-board. And I know that when I have finished these lines I shall be out in that riot of colour and pounding surf, trying to bit those breakers even as he, and failing as he never failed, but living life as the best of us may live it.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Meade (1854-1914) and Robert Eustace (Mystery)\n\n&#8220;That a secret society, based upon the lines of similar institutions so notorious on the Continent during the last century, could ever have existed in the London of our day may seem impossible. Such a society, however, not only did exist, but through the instrumentality of a woman of unparalleled capacity and genius, obtained a firm footing. A century ago the Brotherhood of the Seven Kings was a name hardly whispered without horror and fear in Italy, and now, by the fascinations and influence of one woman, it began to accomplish fresh deeds of unparalleled daring and subtlety in London. By the wide extent of its scientific resources, and the impregnable secrecy of its organisations, it threatened to become a formidable menace to society, as well as a source of serious anxiety to the authorities of the law.&#8221; \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Star Born by Andre Norton (Science fiction, Adventure)\n\nAndre Norton&#8217;s &#8220;Star Born&#8221; pictures a human colony in another galaxy, driven away from Earth generations ago by a repressive government. Considered outlaws, the colonists are in permanent hiding.\n\n\nThey have developed friendship and cooperation with a local race of &#8220;mermen&#8221; who are equally at home on land or sea. But that race only took to the sea to escape a malevolent power that hunted them and killed them violently for sport &#8211; Those Others.\n\n\nWith a global decline in the population and reach of Those Others, contacts are few and the humans have no direct knowlege of them. So it is a major surprise when Dalgard, a human scout on his coming-of-age expedition, along with his &#8220;knife-brother&#8221; Sssuri of the mermen, run into a party of Those Others who are bent on reclaiming hideous weaponries left behind in one of their abandoned cities&#8230; and find that they are being aided by new arrivals from Earth!\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

The early chapters, set in Jerusalem, discuss Jesus&#8217;s Resurrection, his Ascension, the coming of the Holy Spirit on the Day of Pentecost, how God added disciples to the Christ&#8217;s church, and the start of the Twelve Apostles&#8217; ministry. The later chapters discuss Paul&#8217;s conversion, his ministry, and finally his arrest and imprisonment and trip to Rome.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

It also provides the basis for the practice of blessing the sick with an anointing of oil. The book has been historically controversial because of its teaching that both faith and works are necessary to salvation. The great promise in the book is that those who are honestly seeking wisdom may receive it by asking for divine help.&#8221;\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Erewhon by Samuel Butler (Science fiction, Satire)\n\nErewhon, or Over the Range is a novel by Samuel Butler, published anonymously in 1872. The title is also the name of a country, supposedly discovered by the protagonist. In the novel, it is not revealed in which part of the world Erewhon is, but it is clear that it is a fictional country. Butler meant the title to be read as the word Nowhere backwards, even though the letters &#8220;h&#8221; and &#8220;w&#8221; are transposed. It is likely that he did this to protect himself from accusations of being unpatriotic, although Erewhon is obviously a satire of Victorian society. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Ronicky Doone by Max Brand (Westerns)\n\nFrederick Schiller Faust (1892-1944), is best known today for his western fiction. Faust was born in Seattle, Washington and at an early age moved with his parents to the San Joaquin Valley in California where he worked as a ranchhand. After a failed attempt to enlist in the Great War in 1917 and with the help of Mark Twain&#8217;s sister he met Robert Hobart Davis, editor of All-Story Weekly and became a regular contributor writting under his most used pseudonym &#8220;Max Brand&#8221;. He wrote in many genres during his career and produced more than 300 western novels and stories. His most famous characters were Destry and Dr. Kildare, both of which were produced in film. Faust was killed in Italy in 1944 as a front line war correspondent at the age of 51. He is buried in the Sicily-Rome American Cemetery in Nettuno, Italy.\n\nRonicky Doone (1921) is a hero of the west, respected by the law-abiding citizen and hated by bushwhacking bandits. Bill Gregg is a man in love, not about to be deflected from meeting his lady love for the first time, and willing to stand up to the living legend to reach her. This initial meeting leads to a friendship between the two and they travel east to New York City on the trail of the girl. When they find the girl, Caroline Smith, and she refuses to leave, Ronicky must discover the secret that holds her. They encounter the sinister John Mark and the beautiful Ruth Tolliver and are exposed to the horrors and vices of big city life as they attempt to rescue Caroline and find their way back to the mountain-desert of the west. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Seine Frau und seine Kinder hat er auf der &#220;berfahrt an Sklavenh&#228;ndler verkauft &#8211; so erz&#228;hlt man sich. Stattdessen hat Herr Bulemann zwei gro&#223;e Katzen mitgebracht.

In den folgenden Jahren suchen ihn Pfandgl&#228;ubiger auf, welche ihre Pfandg&#252;ter ausl&#246;sen wollen und die er bestechen muss, damit sie sein widerrechtliches Handeln nicht ausplaudern. Er wird immer unleidlicher und menschenscheuer, bis sein einziger Kontakt zur Au&#223;enwelt seine Haush&#228;lterin ist, die ihn verachtet. Schlie&#223;lich weist er schroff seine Halbschwester zur&#252;ck, als sie ihn wegen ihres kr&#228;nklichen Sohnes um Hilfe anfleht und verschuldet letztlich den Tod seines Neffen. Seine Schwester verflucht ihn, woraufhin sich die beiden Katzen nach und nach schauerlich verwandeln und ihn f&#252;r immer in seinem Haus festhalten, aus dem die Haush&#228;lterin inzwischen geflohen ist.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne (Historical Fiction)\n\nThe story begins in seventeenth-century Salem, Massachusetts, then a Puritan settlement. A young woman, Hester Prynne, is led from the town prison with her infant daughter, Pearl, in her arms and the scarlet letter &#8220;A&#8221; on her breast. The scarlet letter &#8220;A&#8221; represents the act of adultery that she has committed; it is to be a symbol of her sin for all to see. She will not reveal her lover&#8217;s identity, however, and the scarlet letter, along with her public shaming, is her punishment for her sin and her secrecy.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
