Though living very simply, tending cows, goats, sheep and rabbits, Paula has been brought up to know and love the Lord Jesus and read the Scriptures. Her Lord and His Word are the center of her life, and she can no more keep this good news all to herself than she can stop breathing or eating. This causes a good many complications, for her cousins&apos; home was one where &quot;religion&quot; was a forbidden subject, never to be mentioned, and Paula soon found herself forbidden to read her own precious Bible.\n\nPaula&apos;s loving obedience, her happy friendliness and charm, her overflowing love for everyone she meets, win the hearts of all, family and neighbors alike, and cause many a change in that little French village on the road from Rouen to Darnetal.\n\nThis book was originally written in French, Translated into Spanish, and then into English.\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Coming Race by Edward George Bulwer-Lytton\n\t\t\nEdward George Earle Lytton Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton (1803-1873) was an English novelist, poet, playright, and politician. Lord Lytton was a florid, popular writer of his day, who coined such phrases as &#8220;the great unwashed&#8221;, &#8220;pursuit of the almighty dollar&#8221;, &#8220;the pen is mightier than the sword&#8221;, and the infamous incipit &#8220;It was a dark and stormy night.&#8221; Despite his popularity in his heyday, today his name is known as a byword for bad writing. San Jose State University holds an annual Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest for bad writing in which contestants have to supply terrible openings of imaginary novels, inspired by his novel Paul Clifford, which opens with the famous words: &#8220;It was a dark and stormy night&#8221;.\n\nThe Coming Race drew heavily on his interest in the occult and contributed to the birth of the science fiction genre. Unquestionably, its story of a subterranean race of men waiting to reclaim the surface is one of the first science fiction novels. The novel centres on a young, independently wealthy traveler (the narrator), who accidentally finds his way into a subterranean world occupied by beings who seem to resemble angels, who call themselves Vril-ya. The hero soon discovers that they are descendants of an antediluvian civilisation who live in networks of subterranean caverns linked by tunnels. The narrator suggests that in time, the Vril-ya will run out of habitable spaces underground and will start claiming the surface of the earth, destroying mankind in the process, if necessary.\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
