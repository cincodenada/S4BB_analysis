         "description" : "As a Man Thinketh by James Allen (Philisophy)\n\nAllen&#8217;s books illustrate the use of the power of thought to increase personal capabilities. Although he never achieved great fame or wealth, his works continue to influence people around the world, including the New Thought movement.\n\nAllen&#8217;s most famous book, As a Man Thinketh, was published in 1902. It is now considered a classic self-help book. Its underlying premise is that noble thoughts make a noble person, while lowly thoughts make a miserable person.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "War and Peace, Book 05: 1806-1807 by Leo Tolstoy  (War stories, Romance)\n\nWar and Peace (Russian: &#1042;&#1086;&#1081;&#1085;&#1072; &#1080; &#1084;&#1080;&#1088;, Voyna i mir; in original orthography: &#1042;&#1086;&#1081;&#1085;&#1072; &#1080; &#1084;&#1080;&#1088;&#1098;, Voyna i mir&#8221;) is an epic novel by Leo Tolstoy, first published from 1865 to 1869 in Russki Vestnik, which tells the story of Russian society during the Napoleonic Era. It is usually described as one of Tolstoy&#8217;s two major masterpieces (the other being Anna Karenina) as well as one of the world&#8217;s greatest novels.\n\n\nWar and Peace offered a new kind of fiction, with a great many characters caught up in a plot that covered nothing less than the grand subjects indicated by the title, combined with the equally large topics of youth, age and marriage. While today it is considered a novel, it broke so many novelistic conventions of its day that many critics of Tolstoy&#8217;s time did not consider it as such. Tolstoy himself considered Anna Karenina (1878) to be his first attempt at a novel in the European sense.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

It is a wonderfully atmospheric piece that combines narrative, poetry, song, and descriptive writing to great effect. The character of Dick Turpin that we know today &#8211; the dashing highwaymen and unmatched horseman &#8211; can be said to stem directly from this novel, as the most famous part of the book (often published on its own in the past), Turpin&#8217;s Ride To York, is devoted to him. Although seemingly little known to a modern audience, Ainsworth&#8217;s &#8216;Rookwood&#8217; gave the world the image of the highwayman with which we are all so familiar.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

For that rare metal &#8212; invaluable in keeping Earth&#8217;s technology running &#8212; was the target of many greedy eyes. But nevertheless he hadn&#8217;t figured on the special twist the clever Martian brigands would use. So when he found both the ship and himself suddenly in their hands, he knew that there was only one way in which he could hope to save that cargo and his own secret &#8212; that would be by turning space-pirate himself and paying the Brigands of the Moon back in their own interplanetary coin.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Tacitus&#8217; Annals Vol 2 by Publius Cornelius Tacitus (History)\n\nThe Annals was Tacitus&#8217; final work, covering the period from the death of Augustus Caesar in the year 14. He wrote at least 16 books, but books 7-10 and parts of books 5, 6, 11 and 16 are missing. Book 6 ends with the death of Tiberius and books 7-12 presumably covered the reigns of Caligula and Claudius. The remaining books cover the reign of Nero, perhaps until his death in June 68 or until the end of that year, to connect with the Histories. The second half of book 16 is missing, ending with the events of the year 66. We do not know whether Tacitus completed the work or whether he finished the other works that he had planned to write; he died before he could complete his planned histories of Nerva and Trajan, and no record survives of the work on Augustus Caesar and the beginnings of the Empire with which he had planned to complete his work as an historian. Vol 2 is comprised of The Annals Books IV through VI.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

As the scientists begin experimentation on some chicks, the substance is misused by some &#8220;country folk&#8221; who don&#8217;t take it seriously and soon Herakleophorbia IV is running rampant throughout England and then across the globe, creating giant plants and animals that wreak havoc on the land and then the people. Then the first giant babies are revealed and for the first time humanity has to contend with the existence of a new race of giant people. How humanity deals with this shocking new creation is revealed in The Food of the Gods and How it Came to Earth. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Life of Cicero, Vol. I by Anthony Trollope (Biography)\n\n\nMarcus Tullius Cicero (106-43BC) was an orator, statesman, philosopher and prolific correspondent, who rose as a &#8216;new man&#8217; in Rome in the turbulent last years of its republican government. Anthony Trollope, best known as a novelist, admired Cicero greatly and wrote this biography late in life in order to argue his virtues against authors who had granted him literary greatness but questioned his strength as a politician and as a man. He takes a personal approach, affording us an insight into his own mind and times as well as those of his subject.\n\nVolume I covers the period (up to the year 57BC) of Cicero&#8217;s education, his rise through the courts and offices of state to the Consulship, and his exile.\n\nPlease note that footnotes &#8211; predominantly bibliographical citations and Latin quotations &#8211; are omitted unless explicitly referred to in the main text; the appendices, which consist mainly of more substantial extracts from other works, are likewise omitted.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Varied Types by G. K. Chesterton (Essay/Short Non-Fiction)\n\nAnother delightful and sharply pointed excursion into the topics of the day, and of our day as well, with Gilbert Keith Chesterton. Here he uses his wit and mastery of paradox to bring into focus a number of historical persons who in many ways typify the people who presently shape our world and who in their own right have already shaped Western civilization. These reprinted magazine articles are filled with his good natured wit and devastating ability to use reductio ad absurdum to destroy the popular myths that drive our society at full-speed into, and expose the utter nonsense that underlies, secular humanism. You will come away with yet another new collection of wonderful quotes\n\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Het blijkt slecht te gaan met het gezin (dus met Nederland) in de 19e eeuw &#8211; en dat ligt aan de jongste zoon, Jan Salie (geest van lamlendigheid die volgens Potgieter heerst in de 19e eeuw). Wat moeten ze met Jan Salie beginnen?\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Didache by Unknown\n\t\t\nThe Didache is the common name of a brief early Christian treatise (dated by most scholars to the late first or early second century), containing instructions for Christian communities. The text, parts of which may have constituted the first written catechism, has three main sections dealing with Christian lessons, rituals such as baptism and eucharist, and Church organization. It was considered by some of the Church Fathers as part of the New Testament but rejected as spurious or non-canonical by others, eventually not accepted into the New Testament canon with the exception of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church &#8220;broader canon.&#8221; The Roman Catholic Church has accepted it as part of the collection of Apostolic Fathers. The Didache, or Teaching of the Twelve Apostles, is an early Christian text. Scholars knew of the Didache through references in other texts, but the text itself had been lost. It was rediscovered in 1873 by Philotheos Bryennios.\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "In this biography for young adults, Mary A. Hamilton gives a British person&#8217;s perspective on the 16th President of the United States. A glowing tribute to &#8220;Honest Abe&#8221;, the author traces Lincoln&#8217;s ancestral roots and recounts his birth in Kentucky, his youth in Indiana, his adult life in Illinois and his years in the White House. She also provides a good background on the causes and course of the American Civil War.\n\nHamilton is not always historically precise. For example, she erroneously names Jefferson Davis as the Southern Democratic candidate for president running against Lincoln and Douglas in 1860 rather than John C. Breckinridge. However, overall &#8220;The Story of Abraham Lincoln&#8221; is a good summarization and interesting account of the life, values and politics of Lincoln.\n\nCautions: Chapter 7 contains a single use of an epithet for African-Americans in a quotation from a British magazine. Chapter 8 ends with an example of a stereotypical Southern black dialect which many may find offensive.",

As he travels further from home, he single-handedly takes on outlaws, settles (and starts) feuds and tries his hand at romancing the girls. He also discovers a lot of strange customs among other folks, such as building houses out of boards and wearing clothes that ain&#8217;t buckskins. Set in Nevada during the late 1800&#8217;s, this collection of stories is a great rollicking romp through the American frontier as seen through the eyes of one of the most enjoyable characters created in the history of tall tales.",
