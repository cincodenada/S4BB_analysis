         "description" : "From the Earth to the Moon by Jules Verne (Adventure, Science fiction, Teen/Young adult)\nTranslated by Lewis Page Mercier (1820-1875) and Eleanor E. King.\n\nFrom the Earth to the Moon (French: De la Terre &#224; la Lune) is a humorous science fantasy story written in 1865 by Jules Verne and is one of the earliest entries in that genre. It tells the story of three well-to-do members of a post-American Civil War gun club who build an enormous sky-facing columbiad and ride a spaceship fired from it to the moon.\n\nNote: From the Earth to the Moon ends in a bit of a cliffhanger. The story continues with Round the Moon.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

It tells the story of Henry Higgins, a professor of phonetics (based on phonetician Henry Sweet), who makes a bet with his friend Colonel Pickering that he can successfully pass off a Cockney flower girl, Eliza Doolittle, as a refined society lady by teaching her how to speak with an upper class accent and training her in etiquette. In the process, Higgins and Doolittle grow close, but she ultimately rejects his domineering ways and declares she will marry Freddy Eynsford-Hill &#8211; a young, poor, gentleman.\n\nThe play was later the basis for the successful movie adaptation &#8220;My Fair Lady&#8221; with Audrey Hepburn as Eliza and Rex Harrison as Prof. Higgins.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Awakening by Kate Chopin (Romance)\n\nOwing to its highly personal content focused on feminine sexuality, this LibriVox edition was recorded by eight female readers.\n\nThe Modern Library edition of The Awakening has an introduction by Kay Gibbons, who writes: &#8220;The Awakening shocked turn-of-the-century readers with its forthright treatment of sex and suicide. Departing from literary convention, Kate Chopin failed to condemn her heroine&#8217;s desire for an affair with the son of a Louisiana resort owner, whom she meets on vacation. The power of sensuality, the delusion of ecstatic love, and the solitude that accompanies the trappings of middle- and upper-class life are the themes of this now-classic novel.&#8221; &#8211; As Kay Gibbons points out, Chopin &#8220;was writing American realism before most Americans could bear to hear that they were living it.&#8221;\n\nTo give you an idea of the subject matter, Project Gutenburg catalogues The Awakening under &#8220;Adultery &#8212; Fiction &#8212; Women &#8212; Louisiana &#8212; New Orleans &#8212; Social conditions.&#8221;\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

(Philosophy)\nTranslated by John Miller Dow Meiklejohn.\n\nThe Critique of Pure Reason, first published in 1781 with a second edition in 1787, has been called the most influential and important philosophical text of the modern age.\n\nKant saw the Critique of Pure Reason as an attempt to bridge the gap between rationalism (there are significant ways in which our concepts and knowledge are gained independently of sense experience) and empiricism (sense experience is the ultimate source of all our concepts and knowledge) and, in particular, to counter the radical empiricism of David Hume (our beliefs are purely the result of accumulated habits, developed in response to accumulated sense experiences). Using the methods of science, Kant demonstrates that though each mind may, indeed, create its own universe, those universes are guided by certain common laws, which are rationally discernable.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Captain Blood by Rafael Sabatini (Adventure)\n\nCaptain Blood is an adventure novel by Rafael Sabatini, originally published in 1922. It concerns the sharp-witted Dr. Peter Blood, an Irish physician, who is convicted of treason in the aftermath of the Monmouth rebellion in 1685, and enslaved on the Caribbean island of Barbados. He escapes and becomes a pirate.\n\nCaptain Blood was the basis for the Academy Award-nominated swashbuckling film that rocketed Errol Flynn and Olivia de Haviland to stardom in Hollywood. The fast-paced historical fiction of Rafael Sabatini is often compared with that of Robert Louis Stevenson and Alexandre Dumas. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

This is the delightful first of twenty volumes in the Ars&#232;ne Lupin series written by Leblanc himself. In an unprecedented act of literary pastiche and cross-over, Sherlock Holmes and Lupin actually meet, briefly in this first volume, and more substantially in the next. But after legal objections from Conan Doyle, the name was changed to &#8220;Herlock Sholmes.&#8221; \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Selected Early Poems of William Carlos Williams (Poetry)\n\nWilliams was born in Rutherford, New Jersey, a community near the city of Paterson. His father was an English immigrant, and his mother was born in Puerto Rico. He attended public school in Rutherford until 1897, then was sent to study at Ch&#226;teau de Lancy near Geneva, Switzerland, the Lyc&#233;e Condorcet in Paris, France, for two years and Horace Mann School in New York City. Then, in 1902, he entered the University of Pennsylvania Medical School. During his time at Penn, Williams befriended Ezra Pound, Hilda Doolittle (best known as H.D.) and the painter Charles Demuth. These friendships supported his growing passion for poetry. He received his M.D. in 1906 and spent the next four years in internships in New York City and in travel and postgraduate studies abroad (e.g., at the University of Leipzig where he studied pediatrics). He returned to Rutherford in 1910 and began his medical practice, which lasted until 1951. Ironically, most of his patients knew little if anything of his writings; instead they viewed him as a doctor who helped deliver over 2,000 of their children into the world. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The King in Yellow (part 2) by Robert W. Chambers (Short Stories)\n\nRobert W. Chambers (1865-1933) studied art in Paris in the late 80&#8217;s and early 90&#8217;s. Shortly after returning to America, he became popular as the writer of a number of romantic novels; he is now best known as the author of &#8220;The King In Yellow&#8221;, which is a collection of short stories with the reputation of being eerie and other-worldly. However, the last few stories in the collection, which are presented here, are essentially straightforward love stories, strongly coloured by the author&#8217;s life as an artist in France.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen (Romance)\n\nThe two eldest Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne, one of whom (Elinor) embraces practicality and restraint while the other (Marianne) gives her whole heart to every endeavor. When the Dashwoods &#8211; mother Mrs. Dashwood, Elinor, Marianne, and youngest sister Margaret &#8211; are sent, almost impoverished, to a small cottage in Devonshire after the death of their father and the machinations of their brother&#8217;s wife, they accept their new circumstances with as much cheer as they can muster even though their brother and his wife have taken over the family estate and fortune. Marianne finds herself falling in love with the dashing Willoughby, who ends up being not all that he appears. Elinor, the more sensible of the two, falls for Edward Ferrars, a match that seems much more suitable. All of these pleasant connections are, however, soon disrupted. Willoughby leaves and ignores Marianne. Elinor finds out an unexpected secret about Ferrars that puts her on her caution in pursuing their relationship. As these complications develop, Marianne soon finds herself distraught despite having attracted another suitor, the reliable, but older, Colonel Brandon. Elinor steps into the breach to try to help her sister regain her equilibrium. Both learn what a broken heart can feel like and adjust in their own separate ways.\nSince this is an Austen novel and a romance, be assured that all comes right in the end.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

His friend Professor Wilson, however, is not only convinced that psychical powers are real, but eagerly desires that Gilroy should be persuaded. To this end, Wilson invites Austin to his house for a demonstration. The effect is that Austin, although still skeptical, now concedes that there is more in the matter than he at first believed. But when the psychic, Miss Penclosa, controls his actions to the point where he nearly murders his fiancee, Austin Gilroy doubts no longer.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Like &#8216;Robinson Crusoe&#8217;, &#8216;Moll Flanders&#8217; and several other of his novels, Defoe published this work as though it were based on primary sources and was not, so he pretended, a novel at all. This was Defoe&#8217;s way of developing an audience among the reading public for fiction writing.\n\nThe work is remarkable in its abundant use of &#8220;telling detail&#8221; to create an impression of verisimilitude, and for nearly two hundred years it was widely considered a pioneering work of journalism rather than a novel. Indeed, it is still assigned as required reading in journalism courses\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
