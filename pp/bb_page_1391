This proves impossible, and she gives up her fortune to marry for love.\n\nJane Austen referred to Cecilia and other novels in her novel, Northanger Abbey: &#8220;&#8217;And what are you reading, Miss &#8212; ?&#8217; &#8216;Oh! It is only a novel!&#8217; replies the young lady, while she lays down her book with affected indifference, or momentary shame. &#8216;It is only Cecilia, or Camilla, or Belinda&#8217;; or, in short, only some work in which the greatest powers of the mind are displayed, in which the most thorough knowledge of human nature, the happiest delineation of its varieties, the liveliest effusions of wit and humour, are conveyed to the world in the best&#8211;chosen language. The title of Austen&#8217;s Pride and Prejudice may have been inspired by a passage at the end of Cecilia: &#8220;remember: if to pride and prejudice you owe your miseries, so wonderfully is good and evil balanced, that to pride and prejudice you will also owe their termination.&#8221;\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The City of God by Saint Augustine of Hippo. Translated by Marcus Dods. (Philosophy, Religion, Literature)\n\nRome having been stormed and sacked by the Goths under Alaric their king, the worshipers of false gods, or pagans, as we commonly call them, made an attempt to attribute this calamity to the Christian religion, and began to blaspheme the true God with even more than their wonted bitterness and acerbity. It was this which kindled my zeal for the house of God, and prompted me to undertake the defense of the city of God against the charges and misrepresentations of its assailants. This work was in my hands for several years, owing to the interruptions occasioned by many other affairs which had a prior claim on my attention, and which I could not defer.\n\nHowever, this great undertaking was at last completed in twenty-two books. Of these, the first five refute those who fancy that the polytheistic worship is necessary in order to secure worldly prosperity, and that all these overwhelming calamities have befallen us in consequence of its prohibition. In the following five books I address myself to those who admit that such calamities have at all times attended, and will at all times attend, the human race, and that they constantly recur in forms more or less disastrous, varying only in the scenes, occasions, and persons on whom they light, but, while admitting this, maintain that the worship of the gods is advantageous for the life to come. In these ten books, then, I refute these two opinions, which are as groundless as they are antagonistic to the Christian religion.\n\nBut that no one might have occasion to say, that though I had refuted the tenets of other men, I had omitted to establish my own, I devote to this object the second part of this work, which comprises twelve books, although I have not scrupled, as occasion offered, either to advance my own opinions in the first ten books, or to demolish the arguments of my opponents in the last twelve. Of these twelve books, the first four contain an account of the origin of these two cities&#8212;the city of God, and the city of the world. The second four treat of their history or progress; the third and last four, of their deserved destinies. And so, though all these twenty-two books refer to both cities, yet I have named them after the better city, and called them The City of God. (Summary by the author in his Retractationes (Excerpt from book ii. 43, as translated by Marcus Dods)\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Commentaries on the Laws of England (1765) by William Blackstone (Philosophy, Politics)\n\nThe Commentaries on the Laws of England are an influential 18th century treatise on the common law of England by Sir William Blackstone, originally published by the Clarendon Press at Oxford, 1765-1769.\n\nThe Commentaries were long regarded as the leading work on the development of English law and played a role in the development of the American legal system. They were in fact the first methodical treatise on the common law suitable for a lay readership since at least the Middle Ages. The common law of England has relied on precedent more than statute and codifications and has been far less amenable than the civil law, developed from the Roman law, to the needs of a treatise. The Commentaries were influential largely because they were in fact readable, and because they met a need. The work is as much an apologia for the legal system of the time as it is an explanation; even when the law was obscure, Blackstone sought to make it seem rational, just, and inevitable that things should be how they were. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Heretics by G. K. Chesterton (Philosophy, Religion)\n\nThe Author Gilbert Keith Chesterton was born in London, England on the 29th of May, 1874. Though he considered himself a mere &#8220;rollicking journalist,&#8221; he was actually a prolific and gifted writer in virtually every area of literature. \nA man of strong opinions and enormously talented at defending them, his exuberant personality nevertheless allowed him to maintain warm friendships with people&#8211;such as George Bernard Shaw and H. G. Wells&#8211;with whom he vehemently disagreed. Chesterton had no difficulty standing up for what he believed. He was one of the few journalists to oppose the Boer War. His 1922 &#8220;Eugenics and Other Evils&#8221; attacked what was at that time the most progressive of all ideas, the idea that the human race could and should breed a superior version of itself. In the Nazi experience, history demonstrated the wisdom of his once &#8220;reactionary&#8221; views.\n\n\nChesterton wrote several works of Christian apologetics, the best known of which are &#8220;Othodoxy&#8221;, &#8220;Heretics&#8221;, and &#8220;The Everlasting Man&#8221;.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Les Chants de Maldoror by Comte de Lautr&#233;amont (Poetry) Language: French\n\nLes Chants de Maldoror is a poetic novel (or a long prose poem) consisting of six cantos. It was written between 1868 and 1869 by the Comte de Lautreamont, the pseudonym of Isidore Lucien Ducasse. Many of the surrealists in the early 1900s cited the novel as a major inspiration to their own works and Les Chants de Maldoror, and its protagonist Maldoror, have continued to fascinate people since its publication. The work revolves around the misanthropic character of Maldoror, a figure of absolute evil who is opposed to God and humanity, and has renounced all ties to conventional morality and decency. The iconoclastic imagery and tone is typically violent and macabre, and ostensibly nihilistic. Les Chants de Maldoror is considered to have been a major influence upon French Symbolism, Dada and Surrealism. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Desperate to earn the money to care for herself, she takes one of the few jobs allowed to respectable women in the early Victorian era &#8211; the role of governess to the children of the wealthy. In working with two different families (the Bloomfields and the Murrays), she comes to learn about the troubles that face a young woman who must try to rein in unruly, spoiled children for a living, and about the ability of wealth and status to destroy social values. After her father&#8217;s death, Agnes opens a small school with her mother and finds happiness with a man who loves her for herself. They have three children at the end of the novel, Edward, Agnes and Mary.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Montessori Method by Maria Montessori (Instruction, Philosophy, Psychology)\n\nIn the early 1900&#8217;s Dr. Maria Montessori began to reform educational methods with her work the &#8216;Case dei Bambini&#8217; in Rome, Italy. Montessori began her work by developing methods to educate mentally retarded children, the method she developed was used with several children who at age eight took the state examinations in reading and writing, the children passed with above average scores. Because of this success (which is known as the &#8216;first Montessori Miracle&#8217;) Dr. Montessori was asked to open a school for children in Rome which she did. It was called the Case dei Bambini or &#8220;Children&#8217;s House&#8221;. Now 101 years after the opening of the first Children&#8217;s House we have recorded the first English translation of &#8220;The Montessori Method&#8221; by Maria Montessori. This book explains the Montessori Method of Education which supports spontaneous self-development of children and is used in the Case dei Bambini as well as many many Montessori Schools through out the world.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "This Side of Paradise by F. Scott Fitzgerald (Fiction)\n\nAmory Blaine grew up in a wealthy family and was given an Ivy League education. Without a need to learn a profession, he chiefly dabbled in literature and partying. His school chums were of similar background, and the ideas they reflected to each other grew in their minds to be of the greatest importance. Amory began to think of himself as somewhat of a character in a Rupert Brooke poem (from which the book&#8217;s title is taken).\n\nWorld War I intervened in this happy fog and brought focus to some, doubt to others.\n\nIn the rapidly changing technology of the war era, the financial underpinnings of the Blaine fortune began to fall apart. The deaths of Amory&#8217;s parents left the finances without a rudder and as Amory&#8217;s situation deteriorated he came to realize he had only his interest in literature to fall back upon.\n\nMeanwhile, a series of young women traipsed through his life, attracted to his handsome face and bright wit like moths to a candle. But Amory could never master the role of being a real person&#8230; and, one by one, they traipsed out.\n\nThis Side of Paradise was F. Scott Fitzgerald&#8217;s first novel and was one of the nation&#8217;s most popular books in the year it was published.
