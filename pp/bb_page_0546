         "description" : "An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation by Jeremy Bentham\n\t\t\nJeremy Bentham&apos;s Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation, a classic text in modern philosophy and jurisprudence, first published in 1789, focuses on the principle of utility and how this view of morality ties into legislative practices. Bentham&apos;s ambition in life was to create a complete Utilitarian code of law. The philosophy of utilitarianism argues that the right act or policy is that which would cause &quot;the greatest good for the greatest number of people&quot;, also known as &quot;the greatest happiness principle&quot;, or the principle of utility.\n\nBentham&apos;s principle of utility regards &quot;good&quot; as that which produces the greatest amount of pleasure, and the minimum amount of pain; and &quot;evil&quot; as that which produces the most pain without the pleasure. This concept of pleasure and pain is defined by Bentham as physical as well as spiritual. Bentham writes about this principle as it manifests itself within the legislation of a society. He lays down a set of criteria for measuring the extent of pain or pleasure that a certain decision will create. \nBentham argues that certain unnecessary laws and punishments could ultimately lead to new and more dangerous vices than those being punished to begin with. He is of opinion that the concept of the individual pursuing his or her own happiness cannot be necessarily declared &quot;right&quot;, because often these individual pursuits can lead to greater pain and less pleasure for the society as a whole. Therefore, the legislation of a society is vital to maintaining a society with optimum pleasure and the minimum degree of pain for the greatest amount of people.\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Eben Holden - A Tale of the North Country by Irving Bacheller\n\t\t\nEben Holden - A Tale of the North Country. Having lost both parents and his home in northern Vermont, orphan Willie Brower is taken in by Eben Holden, &quot;Uncle Eb&quot; who transports him westward to save him from being sent to an orphanage. Through the Adirondacks and into the St. Lawrence valley they travel. Eben is kind, happy, and loves to tell stories to the youngster, many of which were to shape the life and ideals of Willie during his life.\n\nThis story follows Willie as a young orphan, later as a journalist, and finally as a soldier who enlists in the army at the outset of the American Civil War. The book was immensely popular when it was published in 1900 and the years to follow, as the characters were all drawn from people who the author had known himself.\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "From the Foundation of the City by Titus Livius\n\t\t\nAb urbe condita, is a monumental history of ancient Rome written in the Latin language by Titus Livius(Livy), an ancient Roman historian. The work covers the time from the stories of Aeneas, the earliest legendary period from before the city&apos;s founding in c. 753 BC, to Livy&apos;s own times in the reign of the emperor, Augustus. The last year covered by Livy is 745 AUC, or 9 BC, the death of Drusus. About 25% of the work survives.\n\nLivy&apos;s History of Rome was in demand from the publication of the first packet. Livy became so famous that a man from Cadiz travelled to Rome just to see him, and once he had seen, returned home. The popularity of the work continued through the entire classical period. A number of Roman authors used Livy, including Aurelius Victor, Cassiodorus, Eutropius, Festus, Florus, Granius Licinianus and Orosius.\n\nLivy wrote during the reign of Augustus, who came to power after a civil war with generals and consuls claiming to be defending the Roman Republic. Livy&apos;s enthusiasm for the republic is evident from the first pentade of his work, and yet the Julio-Claudian family were as much fans of Livy as anyone. Livy must have been viewed as a harmless and irrelevant advocate of the ancient morality, which was a known public stance of the citizens of Patavium.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages interest in Livy fell off. Due to the length of the work the literate class were already reading summaries rather than the work itself, which was tedious to copy, expensive, and required a lot of storage space. It must have been during this period, if not before, that MSS began to be lost without replacement.\n\nThe Renaissance was a time of intense revival; the population discovered that Livy was being lost and large amounts of money changed hands in the rush to collect Livy manuscripts. The poet, Beccadelli, sold a country home for the money to purchase one manuscript copied by Poggio. Petrarch and Pope Nicholas V launched a search for the now missing books. Laurentius Valla published an emended text initiating the field of Livy scholarship. Dante speaks highly of him in his poetry, and Francis I of France commissioned extensive artwork treating Livian themes; Niccol&#242; Machiavelli&apos;s work on republics, the Discourses on Livy is presented as a commentary on the History of Rome. Respect for Livy rose to lofty heights.\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Journals of Robert Falcon Scott Vol 1 by Robert Falcon Scott\n\t\t\nCapt. Robert F. Scott&apos;s bid to be the leader of the first expedition to reach the South Pole is one of the most famous journeys of all time. What started as a scientific expedition turned out to be an unwilling race against a team lead by R. Admunsen to reach the Pole. The Norwegian flag already stood at the end of the trail when Scott&apos;s party reached their target. All the five men of the Scott expedition who took part in the last march to the Pole perished on their way back to safety.\n\nRobert F. Scott kept a journal throughout the journey, all the way to the tragic end, documenting all aspects of the expedition. The famous last words of the journal were: &apos;It seems a pity, but I do not think I can write more. For God&apos;s sake look after our people.&apos;\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Doch sie hat nur Augen f&#252;r den geheimnisvollen polnischen Grafen Martiniz, der jede Nacht die Stunde zwischen zw&#246;lf und ein Uhr im M&#252;nster verbringt. Aus der Residenz ergeht Befehl, den Grafen unbedingt in der Gegend zu halten, da er wegen seines betr&#228;chtlichen Verm&#246;gens mit einer nicht sehr gut beleumundeten und hoch verschuldeten Gr&#228;fin verheiratet werden soll. Auch Idas Pate ist von dem jungen Mann sehr angetan. Kann er das Geheimnis um den Grafen l&#252;ften?\n\nHauff publizierte die Satire unter dem Namen des damals sehr bekannten Unterhaltungsschriftstellers Heinrich Clauren. Das Buch wurde ein gro&#223;er Erfolg und provozierte einen Skandal, als Hauffs Autorenschaft ans Licht kam.\nHauff war durchaus kein Freund von seichter Unterhaltungsliteratur. In der Kontrovers-Predigt, den letzten beiden Abschnitten dieses Projekts, entlarvt er diese Sorte Literatur als Schund und Kitsch. Trotz seiner Bem&#252;hungen, den Lesern durch &#220;bers&#228;ttigung den Appetit auf solche Geschichten zu nehmen, ist &quot;Der Mann im Mond&quot; eine unterhaltsame Erz&#228;hlung und nicht so seicht geraten, wie Hauff beabsichtigte.\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Chris found himself the pupil of Mr. Wicker, not the old man he first saw, but a powerful man in his forties&#8211;a magician. Chris learned how to turn himself into a fish, a bird, a fly, and with a magic rope he learned to make a boat or even an elephant.\n\nChris had been chosen to sail to China on a mysterious mission. Long before he sailed, Chris met the enemies who would try and stop him&#8211;evil Claggett Chew, the dandy Osterbridge Hawsey, the treacherous old beggar Simon Gosler. With a Nubian boy Chris brought to life with magic, he set out on his hazardous voyage.\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

May it haunt their houses pleasantly, and no one wish to lay it.&quot;\n\nMARLEY&apos;S GHOST. \n\n&quot;Marley was dead: to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that. The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker, and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it: and Scrooge&apos;s name was good upon &apos;Change, for anything he chose to put his hand to. Old Marley was as dead as a door-nail. \n\nMind! I don&apos;t mean to say that I know, of my own knowledge, what there is particularly dead about a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself, to regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my unhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the Country&apos;s done for. You will therefore permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as dead as a door-nail. \n\nScrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise?&quot;\n\nEbook Reader included! \n\nEbook Reader Features:\n- High Quality Fonts for better Readability.\n- Multi-Bookmarking Support.\n- Multi-EBook Support.\n- Easy trackball and touch screen scrolling.\n- Reading Progress Indicator.\n- Hotkey Page Navigation: Top, Bottom, Page Up, Down.\n\nTroubleshooting:\nIf you encounter any troubles opening the ebook after installation, please try to restart your device (ALT+SHIFT+DEL or pull the battery). Now open the &quot;EBookReader&quot; application and you should be able to read your ebook.\n\nThis product comes with a 30 day value back guarantee. More info: http://s4bb.com/returnpolicy.",

         "description" : "Lord Jim by Joseph Conrad (Adventure)\n\nA classic of early literary modernism, Lord Jim tells the story of a young &#8220;simple and sensitive character&#8221; who loses his honor in a display of cowardice at sea &#8212; and of his expiation of that sin against his own &#8220;shadowy ideal of conduct&#8221; on the remote island of Patusan. The novel, written by Conrad for magazine serialization during an intense and chaotic ten months in 1899 and 1900, has, in the words of Thomas C. Moser, &#8220;the rare distinction of being a masterpiece in two separate genres. It is at once an exotic adventure story of the Eastern seas in the popular tradition of Kipling and Stevenson and a complexly wrought &#8216;art novel&#8217; in the tradition of Flaubert and James.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Wives and Daughters by Elizabeth Cleghorn Gaskell (Literature)\n\nIf you like Jane Austen, you will probably like this book!\n\nMrs. Gaskell, as she was often referred to, is considered one of the greatest British novelists of the Victorian era. She was one of the earliest novelists ever to use dialect in her works, finding often that no word but the vernacular would suffice to convey the meaning she wanted to achieve. She was the author of The Life of Charlotte Bront&#235;, a much-acclaimed and sometimes-reviled biography of her friend and peer.\n\nWives and Daughters revolves around Molly Gibson, only daughter of a widowed doctor living in a provincial English town in the 1830s. The novel was first published in the Cornhill Magazine as a serial from August 1864 to January 1866. When Mrs Gaskell died suddenly in 1865, it was not quite complete, and the last section was written by Frederick Greenwood.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
