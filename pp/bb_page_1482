         "description" : "Leaves of Grass by Walt Whitman (Nature, Poetry)\n\nAmerican poet Walt Whitman&#8217;s Leaves of Grass, is a collection of poems notable for its frank delight in and praise of the senses, during a time when such candid displays were considered immoral. Where much previous poetry, especially English, relied on symbolism, allegory, and meditation on the religious and spiritual, Leaves of Grass exalted the body and the material world.\n\nWhitman was inspired to begin Leaves of Grass after reading an essay by Ralph Waldo Emerson which expressed a need for a uniquely American poet. When the book was first published, Whitman sent a copy to Emerson, whose praiseful letter of response helped launch the book to success. Whitman&#8217;s hero, Abraham Lincoln, read and enjoyed an early version of Leaves of Grass. Despite such high recommendations, Whitman faced charges of obscenity and immorality for his work, but this only led to increased popularity of the book.\n\nWhitman continually revised and republished Leaves of Grass throughout his lifetime, notably adding the &#8220;Drum-Taps&#8221; section after Lincoln&#8217;s assassination. The book grew from 12 poems in its first publication, which Whitman paid for and typeset himself, to nearly 400 poems in its final, &#8220;Death Bed Edition.&#8221; This recording is of the final edition.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Woyzeck by Georg B&#252;chner (Play) (German)\n\nWoyzeck ist ein Dramenfragment des deutschen Dramatikers und Dichters Georg B&#252;chner. B&#252;chner begann vermutlich zwischen Juni und September 1836 mit der Niederschrift. Bei seinem fr&#252;hen Tod im Jahr 1837 blieb das Werk als Fragment zur&#252;ck. Das Manuskript ist in mehreren Entwurfsstufen &#252;berliefert. Im Druck erschien Woyzeck erstmals 1879 in der stark &#252;berarbeiteten und vom Herausgeber ver&#228;nderten Fassung von Karl Emil Franzos. &#8220;Woyzeck&#8221; wurde am 8. November 1913 im Residenztheater M&#252;nchen uraufgef&#252;hrt.\nDer einfache Soldat Franz Woyzeck, der seine Freundin Marie und das gemeinsame uneheliche Kind, die genau wie er am Rande der Gesellschaft leben, zu unterst&#252;tzen versucht, arbeitet als Laufbursche f&#252;r seinen Hauptmann. Dieser und ein skrupelloser Arzt nutzen Franz physisch und psychisch aus. Marie l&#228;sst sich mit einem Tambourmajor ein und Woyzecks aufkeimender Verdacht wird durch ihm nicht freundlich gesonnene Mitmenschen gesch&#252;rt, bis die Handlung eskaliert.\nAnmerkung: Dieses St&#252;ck ist ein Fragment. Es gibt keine einzig richtige Reihenfolge der einzelnen Szenen, denn sie sind weder numeriert noch in Akte aufgeteilt. Die hier vorliegende Reihenfolge stimmt gro&#223;enteils mit der Verfilmung mit Klaus Kinski in der Hauptrolle &#252;berein. &#220;berdies ist jede Szene in einer gesondert aufgenommen, so da&#223; das Werk auf &#8220;shuffle&#8221; geh&#246;rt werden kann, um neue Interpretationen zu finden.\nDas St&#252;ck spielt in Darmstadt, die Figuren sprechen gr&#246;&#223;tenteils in dortigem Dialekt. Deshalb haben im Hochdeutschen grammatikalisch falsche Konstruktionen hier seine Richtigkeit.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Concerning Virgins by Saint Ambrose (Religion)\nTranslated by H. De Romestin with the assistance of E. De Romestin and Henry Thomas Forbes Duckworth.\n\nConcerning Virgins (De Virginibus) is a series of letters, compiled into three &#8220;books,&#8221; St. Ambrose wrote to his sister, Manellia, These, perhaps Ambrose&#8217;s earliest writings, were written in 377 CE.\n\nWritten in a rather light-handed non-technical style they appear as ethical guides to women who are contemplating entering nunneries. More importantly, they set the tone for Ambrose&#8217;s later writing on ethics.\n\nConcerning Virgins was referred to by other patristic writers including St. Jerome, St Augustine and Cassian, and are now included in the extra-biblical cannon of the early church fathers.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Outlaws in Tunstall Forest organized by Ellis Duckworth, whose weapon and calling card is a black arrow, cause Dick to suspect that his guardian Sir Daniel Brackley and his retainers are responsible for his father&#8217;s murder. Dick&#8217;s suspicions are enough to turn Sir Daniel against him, so he has no recourse but to escape from Sir Daniel and join the outlaws of the Black Arrow against him. This struggle sweeps him up into the greater conflict surrounding them all. The story of the Wars of the Roses is told in miniature by The Black Arrow. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Pickwick Papers by Charles Dickens (Satire)\n\nThe Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club, better known as The Pickwick Papers, is the first novel by Charles Dickens. Written for publication as a serial, The Pickwick Papers consists of a sequence of loosely-related adventures. Its main literary value and appeal is formed by its numerous unforgettable heroes. Each personage in The Pickwick Papers (just as in many other Dickens&#8217; novels) is drawn comically, often with exaggerated features of character.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Little Wars by H. G. Wells (Short Stories/Essays)\n\nLittle Wars (A Game for Boys from twelve years of age to one hundred and fifty and for that more intelligent sort of girl who likes boys&#8217; games and books) With an Appendix on Kriegspiel\n\nMiniature wargaming got its start with the publication in 1913 of this thoroughly entertaining little account of how H.G. Wells, with certain of his friends, took their childhood toys and turned play into acceptable middle-aged sport by subjecting the exercise to the civilizing influence of actual rules.\n\nWhile wargaming progressed far past these beginnings, Wells observes how &#8220;little wars&#8221; with even his elementary rules can suggest the wholesale crudity of the real thing.\n\n&#8220;You have only to play at Little Wars three or four times to realise just what a blundering thing Great War must be. Great War is at present, I am convinced, not only the most expensive game in the universe, but it is a game out of all proportion. Not only are the masses of men and material and suffering and inconvenience too monstrously big for reason, but&#8211;the available heads we have for it, are too small. That, I think, is the most pacific realisation conceivable, and Little War brings you to it as nothing else but Great War can do.&#8221;\n\nWells leaves almost hanging the tantalizing concept that we might someday simulate war, as an instrument of international decision-making, rather than practice actual combat.\n\nBut most of this book is just the fun of evicting the boys from the playroom and spending happy days there, away from the &#8220;skirt-swishers&#8221;, developing the framework under which two gentlemen might meet and accumulate boastable victories! \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

The Devil&#8217;s Pool (published in 1846 as La Mare au Diable) is one of several short pastoral novels drawn from her childhood experiences in the rural French region of Berri. It tells the story of a young widower, Germain, who, at the insistence of his father-in-law, sets out to remarry so that he will have someone to help raise his three young children.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
