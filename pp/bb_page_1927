         "description" : "Summa Theologica, Prima Pars, Trinity and Creation by Saint Thomas Aquinas\n\t\t\nThe Summa Theologica (or the Summa Theologiae or simply the Summa, written 1265&#8211;1274) is the most famous work of Thomas Aquinas (c. 1225&#8211;1274) although it was never finished. It was intended as a manual for beginners as a compilation of all of the main theological teachings of that time. It summarizes the reasonings for almost all points of Christian theology in the West, which, before the Protestant Reformation, subsisted solely in the Roman Catholic Church. The Summa&#8217;s topics follow a cycle: the existence of God, God&#8217;s creation, Man, Man&#8217;s purpose, Christ, the Sacraments, and back to God.\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

The work is believed to have continued up to the death of Domitian on September 18, 96. As a prelude to the account of Titus&#8217;s suppression of the Great Jewish Revolt, Book 5 features a short ethnographic survey of the ancient Jews as seen from the Roman point of view.

The book as we have it nowadays consists of 21 letters, divided in two parts. The first is composed of fifteen letters presented as if written by a female mythological character to her lover; the second part, also known as Double Heroides, brings three pairs of letters, being the first in each pair supposedly written by a hero, and the second one, the heroine&#8217;s response to the first letter. Along the Metamorphoses and the Ars Amatoria, the Heroides were one of the most influential works of Ovid, not only in the Antiquity, but also throughout the Middle Ages and up to Modern times.\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Uller Uprising by H. Beam Piper\n\t\t\nUller Uprising is the story of a confrontation between a human overlord and alien servants, with an ironic twist at the end. Like most of Piper&#8217;s best work, Uller Uprising is modeled after an actual event in human history; in this case the Sepoy Mutiny (a Bengal uprising in British-held India brought about when rumors were spread to native soldiers that cartridges being issued by the British were coated with animal fat. The rebellion quickly spread throughout India and led to the massacre of the British Colony at Cawnpore.). Piper&#8217;s novel is not a mere retelling of the Indian Mutiny, but rather an analysis of an historical event applied to a similar situation in the far future.\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The House of a Thousand Candles by Meredith Nicholson\n\t\t\nA top ten bestseller of 1906, The House of a Thousand Candles is part adventure/mystery and part romance. The book begins with young Jack Glenarm returning from various exploits in Europe and Africa for the reading of his grandfather&#8217;s will. In it, he stands to inherit his grandfather&#8217;s estate, but only if he can remain for one year in residence at the old man&#8217;s unfinished &#8220;House of a Thousand Candles&#8221; in Annandale, Indiana, with only his grandfather&#8217;s mysterious valet for company. If he violates the terms of the will, the house will go to a young woman, heretofore unknown to him, whom the will also forbids Jack to marry if he wants to retain his inheritance. This all sounds very mundane to Jack and he fully expects to be quite bored in very short order. Soon after Jack&#8217;s arrival at Glenarm House, however, various strange occurrences ensue, and he soon finds himself absorbed in the most lively adventure of his life!\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

It is narrated by Frank Osbaldistone, the son of an English merchant who travels first to the North of England, and subsequently to the Scottish Highlands to collect a debt stolen from his father. On the way he encounters the larger-than-life title character of Rob Roy MacGregor. Though Rob Roy is not the lead character (in fact the narrative does not move to Scotland until half way through the book) his personality and actions are key to the development of the novel.\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Uncle Silas by J. Sheridan Le Fanu\n\t\t\nUncle Silas is a Victorian Gothic mystery/thriller novel by the Anglo-Irish writer J. Sheridan Le Fanu. It is notable as one of the earliest examples of the locked room mystery subgenre. It is not a novel of the supernatural (despite a few creepily ambiguous touches), but does show a strong interest in the occult and in the ideas of Swedenborg.\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

He soon learns to live the profligate life of a gentleman as he gradually sheds his associations with the gentle souls of his past, Joe (the blacksmith) and Biddy (a level-headed young lady). He throws his money at improving the prospects of his roommate and friend Herbert and his heart at an &#8220;ice princess&#8221; whose heart will never respond. But then an escaped convict from his distant past comes calling, and all Pip&#8217;s hopes dissolve.\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

In this way we find ourselves in a dozen successive scenes, each strongly contrasted with the others. It is the art of the author that he knows exactly how much to tell us without wearying our attention, and is able to make the transition to the next scene a plausible one.\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Following the Equator: A Journey Around the World by Mark Twain\n\t\t\nFollowing the Equator (American English title) or More Tramps Abroad (English title) is a non-fiction travelogue published by American author Mark Twain in 1897.\n\nTwain was practically bankrupt in 1894 due to a failed investment into a &#8220;revolutionary&#8221; typesetting machine. In an attempt to extricate himself from debt of $100,000 (equivalent of about $2 million in 2005) he undertook a tour of the British Empire in 1895, a route chosen to provide numerous opportunities for lectures in the English language.\n\nIn Following the Equator, an account of that travel published in 1897, the author unmasks and criticizes racism, imperialism and missionary zeal in observations woven into the narrative with classical Twain wit.\n\nOf particular interest, historically, are Twain&#8217;s references to Cecil Rhodes in Australia and South Africa, the in-depth description of &#8220;Thugs&#8221; and &#8220;Thuggee&#8221; in India and the Boer War period and diamonds in South Africa.\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Lawrence\n\t\t\nThis intimate portrait of a coal-miner&#8217;s family fastens on each member in turn: Walter Morel, the collier; Gertrude, his wife; and the children: William, Annie, Arthur, and Paul. When Mrs. Morel begins to be estranged from her husband because of his poor financial sense and his drinking habits, she comes to inhabit the lives of her children &#8211; most particularly, her sons. She is determined that they will grow to be something more than men that come home blackened with coal dust every day and roaring with drink every night. As each grows up and moves away, she must release him. But Paul, she holds; they have a bond that defies time and the attractions of young women.\n\nLawrence originally intended the book&#8217;s title to be &#8220;Paul Morel&#8221; and it is on this son &#8211; and his lovers &#8211; that he spends the bulk of his tale. The strong mother can make a success of her son, but if he cannot learn to leave his mother&#8217;s apron strings, will he really be a better man than his father?\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
