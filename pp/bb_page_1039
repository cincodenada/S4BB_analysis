         "description" : "Little Dorrit by Charles Dickens (Fiction, Literature, Satire)\n\nBorn in the Marshalsea Prison for Debtors, Amy&#8212;Little Dorrit&#8212;the daughter of the ruined, but self-respectful William Dorrit, has put her entire heart in caring for her dear father, until one day her humble path is crossed by Arthur Clennam. Their meeting proves providential not only for Amy&#8217;s life, but for the whole Dorrit family, whose new rise will, in many ways, be also their fall. As in all his novels, in &#8220;Little Dorrit&#8221; Dickens ushers us into a fascinating and startlingly rich world of human characters and destinies, where virtue and nobility cross swords with vice and villainy, where strength and weakness intertwine with prejudice and magnanimity and where the author&#8217;s inspired pen wields a compelling and unforgettable power over the readers. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Tom Brown&#8217;s School Days by Thomas Hughes (Memoirs)\n\nTom Brown&#8217;s Schooldays is a novel by Thomas Hughes first published in 1857. The story is set at Rugby School, a public school for boys, in the 1830s. Hughes attended Rugby School from 1834 to 1842.\n\nThe novel was originally published as being &#8220;by an Old Boy of Rugby&#8221;, and much of it is based on the author&#8217;s experiences. Tom Brown is largely based on the author&#8217;s brother, George Hughes; and George Arthur, another of the book&#8217;s main characters, is based on Arthur Penrhyn Stanley. The fictional Tom&#8217;s life also resembles the author&#8217;s in that the culminating event of his school career was a cricket match.\n\nTom Brown was tremendously influential on the genre of British school novels, which began in the 19th century, and is one of the few still in print. A sequel, Tom Brown at Oxford, was published in 1861 but is not as well known. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Gawayne and the Green Knight by Charlton Miner Lewis (Fantasy, Fairy Tales, Poetry)\n\nPublished in 1903, Gawayne and the Green Knight is a modern-language retelling of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, a 14th-century verse romance following a young knight of the Round Table. During Christmas celebrations, a mysterious, entirely green knight presents a challenge to King Arthur&#8217;s court: that any may strike the stranger a single blow with his green axe, provided he assent to receiving the same a year later. Gawayne accepts the challenge, and its unexpected outcome leads to a great test of his courage and knighthood. A significant addition to this version is the Lady Elfinhart, whose back-story and romance with Gawayne are tightly interwoven with the plot.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

(Fiction, Fantasy, Fairy Tales)\n\nUndine is a novel by Friedrich de la Motte Fouqu&#233; concerning Undine, a water spirit who marries a Knight named Huldebrand in order to gain a soul. It is an early German romance, which has been translated into English and other languages. The novel served as inspiration for two operas in the romantic style by Ernst Theodor Amadeus Hoffmann and Albert Lortzing, respectively, and two ballets: the nineteenth century Ondine and the twentieth century Undine. An edition of the book was illustrated by Arthur Rackham. In The Fantastic Imagination, George MacDonald writes, &#8220;Were I asked, what is a fairytale? I should reply, Read Undine: that is a fairytale &#8230; of all fairytales I know, I think Undine the most beautiful.&#8221; \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

It is usually described as one of Tolstoy&#8217;s two major masterpieces (the other being Anna Karenina) as well as one of the world&#8217;s greatest novels.\n\nWar and Peace offered a new kind of fiction, with a great many characters caught up in a plot that covered nothing less than the grand subjects indicated by the title, combined with the equally large topics of youth, age and marriage. While today it is considered a novel, it broke so many novelistic conventions of its day that many critics of Tolstoy&#8217;s time did not consider it as such. Tolstoy himself considered Anna Karenina (1878) to be his first attempt at a novel in the European sense. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "A Doll&#8217;s House by Henrik Ibsen (Fiction)\n\nA Doll&#8217;s House, written two years after The Pillars of Society, was the first of Ibsen&#8217;s plays to create a sensation and is now perhaps his most famous play, and required reading in many secondary schools and universities. The play was highly controversial when first published, as it is sharply critical of 19th Century marriage norms. It follows the formula of well-made play up until the final act, when it breaks convention by ending with a discussion, not an unravelling. It is often called the first true feminist play, although Ibsen denied this.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Evelina by Fanny Burney (Epistolary fiction)\n\nIn this epistolary novel, we find a young woman named Evelina, who was raised in rural seclusion until her eighteenth year because of her uncertain parentage. Through a series of harrowing and humorous events that take place in London and an English resort town, Evelina learns how to navigate the complex layers of 18th century society and earn the love of a distinguished and honorable nobleman. This comedy of manners often satirizes the society in which it is set; Evelina is a significant precursor to later works by Jane Austen and Maria Edgeworth, whose novels explore many of the same issues. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

It concerns the deeply religious residents of a small village in Austria during the late sixteenth century, and what happened to several of them when a strange man began to visit their insulated homeland. There&#8217;s little of Twain&#8217;s humor here; this is a horror story, a parable. . . and a warning.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The String of Pearls by Unknown (Mystery, Horror/Ghost stories)\n\nThe tale of Sweeney Todd has had many incarnations, most famously the stage and movie musical by Stephen Sondheim. But it all started in 1846 with a serialized telling of the story titled &#226;&#8364;&#339;The String of Pearls&#226;&#8364;&#157; in the weekly magazine &#226;&#8364;&#339;The People&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s Periodical and Family Library&#226;&#8364;&#157;. Called by some a romance, by others a horror story, it is one of the earliest murder mysteries. In &#226;&#8364;&#339;The String of Pearls&#226;&#8364;&#157;, Sweeney Todd is less sympathetic than in some of his later incarnations &#226;&#8364;&#8220; a perfect villain, totally self-seeking with no redeeming qualities. How the deeds of Todd are uncovered and how he is brought to justice make a most intriguing tale, but one probably not suited for the very young and certainly not for the squeamish.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
