         "description" : "Preface by King James Version\n\t\t\nThe preface to the KJV Bible is fitting to read, as it reminds contemporary readers of the transitory nature of all Bible translations. The preface is a necessary, though often unread, gift from the translators to readers of the KJV. If you read this preface, or hear it, you will be able to unravel many false teachings associated with the exclusive use of one version. It not only defends the work of the translators, it defends the necessity of a translation for the time and place, to speak in a voice understandable to a contemporary audience. Listen to this preface for a greater appreciation of the work of these fine men.\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Ignatius was an apologist for the Episcopal style of church government (as opposed to sole rule by a council of presbyters) which developed in the late first or early second century. Eager to die in imitation of his Savior, it was Ignatius who wrote this to the Roman church: &#8220;I am God&#8217;s wheat, and I am ground by the teeth of wild beasts that I may be found pure bread [of Christ].&#8221;\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Kidnapped by Robert Louis Stevenson\n\t\t\nDavid Balfour, a lad of seventeen and newly orphaned, is directed to go and live with his rich uncle, the master of the estate of Shaws in the lowlands of Scotland near Edinburgh. His uncle, Ebenezer (as close a miser as Dickens&#8217; Ebenezer Scrooge), is shocked to suddenly have his young relative descend on him and tries to rid himself of David with an arranged accident. Failing that, he pays the captain of a brig to kidnap David and sell him into slavery in Carolina.\n\nA collision in the fog brings onboard the brig a survivor, Alan Breck Stewart, who is carrying a dangerous amount of gold on his person. David warns him of a plan by the brig&#8217;s captain and crew to overpower him and seize the money, and then finds himself fighting alongside Alan in a battle royale. By good fortune, Alan is handy with a sword and they have access to the firearms locker, and the pair so completely defeat the crew that barely enough hands remain to sail her. Limping to port, she is holed by rocks, and David finds himself a castaway.\n\nBeing in Alan&#8217;s presence continues to be a chancy business. David is talking to Colin Roy Campbell, the King&#8217;s Factor who has been oppressing Alan&#8217;s people, when the man is shot to death, and David is chased as an accomplice. The two &#8220;take to the heather&#8221; and barely survive near brushes with redcoats as they thread through the Trossachs and other highland ranges of Scotland. Only after an arduous weeks-long trek through territory where they are actively hunted do they emerge in the more settled districts around the river Forth, only to find guards upon the bridge. With no money remaining, they must somehow cross to Queensferry, find Ebenezer&#8217;s lawyer, and lay claim to David&#8217;s inheritance in order to send Alan safely on to France.\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Im Herzen von Afrika by Georg Schweinfurth\n\t\t\nSchweinfurth trat 1868 im Auftrag der Humboldt-Stiftung in Berlin eine gro&#223;e Reise nach Afrika an. 1869 reiste er von Khartum aus nilaufw&#228;rts nach Faschoda und nach dem Gebiet der Dschur. Mit Sklavenj&#228;gern immer weiter vordringend, durchzog er die L&#228;nder der Bongo, Schilluk, Nuer und der Dinka, unternahm eine Reise zu den menschenfressenden Niam-Niam, besuchte das Land der Mittu und Madi und entdeckte im Lande der bis dahin noch unbekannten, ebenfalls kannibalischen Monbuttu, den Uelleflu&#223; (Uelle-Makua (Ubangi)). Ebenso gewann er sichere Kunde von dem Zwergvolk der Akka. Nach &#220;berwindung der gr&#246;&#223;ten Schwierigkeiten traf er im Juli 1871 wieder wohlbehalten in Khartum ein. &#8220;Die von ihm erlangten Resultate in Ethnographie, Botanik und Geographie reihen sich daher dem Bedeutendsten an, was je auf afrikanischem Boden erreicht worden ist.&#8221; (Friedrich Embacher &#252;ber das Werk Im Herzen von Afrika).

Satan begins by taking away all of Job&#8217;s riches, his livestock, his house, his servants, and his children; a series of four messengers informs him that they have perished in various tragedies. In the meantime, only three of Job&#8217;s friends come to visit him in his misfortune &#8212; Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. A fourth, Elihu the Buzite, first begins talking in chapter 32 and bears a distinguished part in the dialogue; his arrival is not noted. The friends spend a week sitting on the ground with Job, without speaking, until Job at last breaks his silence and complains of his misery.\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
