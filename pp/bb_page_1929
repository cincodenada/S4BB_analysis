         "description" : "O Pioneers! by Willa Cather (Literature)\n\nO Pioneers! tells the story of the Bergsons, a family of Swedish immigrants in the farm country near Hanover, Nebraska, (a fictional town near Glenvil) around the turn of the 20th century. The main character, Alexandra Bergson, inherits the family farmland when her father dies, and she devotes her life to making the farm a viable enterprise at a time when other immigrant families are giving up and leaving the prairie. The novel also concerns two romantic relationships &#8211; one between Alexandra and family friend Carl Lindstrom, and another between Alexandra&#8217;s brother Emil and the married Marie Shabata. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Mystery of Edwin Drood by Charles Dickens (Mystery)\n\nThe Mystery of Edwin Drood is the final novel by Charles Dickens. It is a mystery indeed; the serial novel was just half completed at the time of Dickens&#8217; death &#8211; leading to much speculation how it might have ended.\nThe novel is named after Edwin Drood, one of the characters, but it mostly tells the story of his uncle, a choirmaster named John Jasper, who is in love with his pupil, Rosa Bud. Miss Bud is Drood&#8217;s fianc&#233;e, and has also caught the eye of the high-spirited and hot-tempered Neville Landless! Landless comes from Ceylon with his twin sister, Helena. Neville Landless and Edwin Drood take a dislike to one another the moment they meet.\nThe story is set in Cloisterham, a lightly fictionalised Rochester (in Kent, England). Rochester is close to Dicken&#8217;s country house Gad&#8217;s Hill Place, where the final chapter was written and where Dickens died.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The King of Schnorrers by Israel Zangwill (Religion, Literature, Humor)\n\nManasseh da Costa is a schnorrer (beggar) who lives on the charitable contributions of the Jews of late 18th-century London. But Manasseh is far from being a humble panhandler for, as every schnorrer knows, supporting the poor is a commandment from God (a mitzvah) not just a favour. And as the descendant of Portuguese Jews who had lived in England for many generations, Manasseh is the social superior of those newly arrived from Eastern Europe (called &#8216;Tedesco&#8217;), even his wealthy patron Joseph Grobstock. As this hilarious satire concludes the ever-audacious Manasseh strikes a blow for tolerance&#8212;while helping himself along the way. Israel Zangwill (1864-1926) was born in England of Russian parents. He was the author of &#8220;Children of the Ghetto,&#8221; a novel set in London&#8217;s heavily Jewish East End.\n\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "History of the United States, VCharles Austin Beard (History)\n\nwas the most influential American historian of the early 20th century. He published hundreds of monographs, textbooks and interpretive studies in both history and political science. He graduated from DePauw University in 1898, where he met and eventually married Mary Ritter Beard, one of the founders of the first Greek-letter society for women, Kappa Alpha Theta. Many of his books were written in collaboration with his wife, whose own interests lay in feminism and the labor union movement (Woman as a Force in History, 1946).\n\nIn 1921, Charles and Mary Beard published their History of the United States. A contemporaneous review stated: &#8220;The authors&#8230; assume enough maturity in high school students to justify a topical rather than a chronological treatment. They have dealt with movements, have sketched large backgrounds, have traced causes, and have discussed the interrelation of social and economic forces and politics. All this has been directed to the large purpose of helping the student to understand American today in all its national characteristics and as part of world civilization as well&#8230;The literary style is exceptionally clear and crisp, and the whole approach&#8230;is thought producing. As a textbook or handbook for the average citizen it ranks with very best.&#8221;ol.

         "description" : "North and South (version 2) by  Elizabeth Cleghorn (Historical Fiction)\n\nThe book is a social novel that tries to show the industrial North and its conflicts in the mid-19th century as seen by an outsider, a socially sensitive lady from the South. The story: the heroine, Margaret Hale, is the daughter of a Nonconformist minister who moves to the fictional industrial town of Milton after leaving the Church of England. The town is modeled after Manchester, where Gaskell lived as the wife of a Unitarian minister.\n\nThe change of lifestyle shocks Margaret, who sympathizes deeply with the poverty of the workers and comes into conflict with John Thornton, the owner of a local mill, also a friend of her father. After an encounter with a group of strikers, in which Margaret attempts to protect Thornton from the violence, he proposes to her, telling her that he is in love with her; she rejects his proposal of marriage, mainly because she sees it as if it were out of obligation for what she had done. Later, he sees her with her fugitive brother, whom he mistakes for another suitor, and this creates further unresolved conflict. Margaret, once she believes she has lost his affection, begins to see him in another light, and eventually they are reunited.\n\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

However, the arrival of several regiments preparing for an expected invasion brings colour and chaos to the county.

Set at the time of the Napoleonic wars, this is the author&#8217;s only historical novel, and unusually for Hardy&#8217;s stories, most of the characters live happily ever after. \n\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "How to Live on Twenty-Four Hours a Day by  Arnold Bennett  (Advice)\n\n&#8220;Which of us lives on twenty-four hours a day? And when I say &#8216;lives,&#8217; I do not mean exists, nor &#8216;muddles through.&#8217;&#8221;\n\nArnold Bennett knew a &#8220;rat race&#8221; when he saw one. Every day, his fellow white-collar Londoners followed the same old routine. And they routinely decried the sameness in their lives.\n\nSo Bennett set out to explain how to inject new enthusiasm into living. In this delightful little work, he taught his fellow sufferers how to set time apart for improving their lives. Yes, he assured them, it could be done. Yes, if you want to feel connected with the world, instead of endlessly pacing the treadmill (or, &#8220;exceeding your programme&#8221;, as he called it), you must do so.\n\nFor time, as he gleefully notes, is the ultimate democracy. Each of us starts our day with 24 hours to spend. Even a saint gets not a minute more; even the most inveterate time-waster is docked not a second for his wastrel ways. And he can choose today to turn over a new leaf!\n\nBennett believed that learning to discern cause and effect in the world would give his readers an endless source of enjoyment and satisfaction. Instead of only being able to discuss what they had heard, they could graduate to what they thought&#8230; and lift themselves completely from the deadening influence of a day at the office.\n\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Sisters by Ada Cambridge (Story)\n\nAda Cambridge (November 21, 1844 &#8211; July 19, 1926), later known as Ada Cross, was an English born Australian writer. While she gained recognition as Australia&#8217;s first woman poet of note, her longer term reputation rests on her novels. Overall she wrote more than twenty-five works of fiction, three volumes of poetry and two autobiographical works. Many of her novels were serialised in Australian newspapers, and were never published in book form.\n\nThe story pans over three &#8211; four decades revolving the four Pennycuick sisters.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Wells had so much fun playing with his children on the floor of their playroom, he decided to write a jovial little book to inspire other parents in their pursuit of quality time with the kids. While the raw materials available from hobby stores of his day were woefully short of the variety and quality of what can be bought easily now, he and his sons created their own worlds to rule. This short work describes two games of imagination played out upon the floor of his home &#8211; an archipelago of islands, and a thoroughly integrated city, conveniently organized with two mayoral positions for his sons &#8220;G.P.W.&#8221; and &#8220;F.R.W.&#8221; While the toy people appearing in their worlds were often of martial nature, Wells decided to leave decription of military games to a later book: &#8220;Little Wars.&#8221;\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Camera Obscura by Nicolaas Beets (Humor) Language: Dutch\n\nDe Camera Obscura is een verzameling verhalen en beschouwingen van Hildebrand, pseudoniem voor Nicolaas Beets. &#8220;De Camera&#8221;, zoals het boek gemeenzaam is gaan heten, verscheen in 1839. Beets schreef de meeste stukken in 1837 als student Godgeleerdheid in Leiden. Het boek geeft een beeld van het Nederland van de trekschuit en de postkoets, waar rond die tijd gewerkt wordt aan de eerste spoorlijn. Het bekendste gedeelte van het boek is dat over de familie Stastok. Hierin gaat Hildebrand logeren bij een oom en tante die de vleesgeworden burgermensen zijn uit het begin 19e eeuw. Schrijnend is &#8220;Het diakenhuismannetje vertelt zijn verhaal&#8221;, dat blijk geeft van inzicht van de schrijver in de wantoestanden in zijn tijd. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

They were popular best-sellers at the time they were published and the original editions are still readily available in used book shops. The novels gave their name to a fictional genre called Graustarkian: this genre contains tales of romance and intrigue usually featuring titled characters in small, fictional, Central European countries.\n\nDuring the 1870&#8217;s, Graustark&#8217;s ruler, Prince Ganlook, was killed in a war with neighboring Axphain. As part of the ensuing peace treaty, Graustark agreed to pay a large indemnity to Axphain, to be due, with interest, in fifteen years.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
