         "description" : "Bartleby the Scrivener by Herman Melville (Literature)\n\n&#8220;Bartleby the Scrivener: A Story of Wall Street&#8221; is a short story by Herman Melville. The story first appeared, anonymously, in Putnam&#8217;s Magazine in two parts. The first part appeared in November 1853, with the conclusion published in December 1853. It was reprinted in Melville&#8217;s The Piazza Tales in 1856 with minor textual alterations. The work is said to have been inspired, in part, by Melville&#8217;s reading of Emerson, and some have pointed to specific parallels to Emerson&#8217;s essay, &#8220;The Transcendentalist.&#8221; \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "A History of Greece to the Death of Alexander the Great, Vol 1 by John Bagnell Bury (History)\n\nJ.B. Bury wrote his &#8220;History of Greece&#8221; before World War I, but it was such a good overview of classical Greek history that the third edition was still being used as a college textbook in the late 1960&#8217;s. In the newer editions, a co-author rewrote the material dealing with the early centuries where there have been new archeological developments, but the later chapters and Bury&#8217;s framework were retained essentially unchanged. Bury writes in a lucid, easily understood style that entertains as it educates. The book covers artistic and literary development, as well as politics and war, and its field of view includes western Asia Minor, the Agean archipelago, and &#8220;Greater Greece&#8221; (Sicily and Southern Italy).\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "A House-Boat on the Styx by John Kendrick Bangs (Fantasy, Fiction)\n\nThe premise of the book is that everyone who has ever died (up until the time in which the book is set, which seems to be about the time of its publication) has gone to Styx. This does not appear to be the conventional Hell described by Dante in The Inferno, but rather the Hades described in Greek myth (both of which had Styxes): a universal collecting pot for dead souls, regardless of their deeds in life.\n\nThe book begins with Charon, ferryman of the Styx (in The Inferno, he was the ferryman of the river Acheron) being startled&#8212;and annoyed&#8212;by the arrival of a house boat on the Styx. At first afraid that the boat will put him out of business, he later finds out that he is actually to be appointed the boat&#8217;s janitor.\n\nWhat follows are eleven more stories (for a total of twelve) which are set on the house boat. There is no central theme, and the purpose of the book appears to be as a literary thought experiment to see what would happen if various famous dead people were put in the same room with each other. Each chapter is a short story featuring various souls from history and mythology.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

It is a letter from Paul of Tarsus to a number of early Christian communities in the Roman province of Galatia in central Anatolia. It is principally concerned with the controversy surrounding Gentile Christians and the Mosaic Law within Early Christianity. Along with the Epistle to the Romans, it is the most theologically significant of the Pauline epistles, and has been particularly influential in Protestant thought. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Legends of the Jews, Volume 1 by Louis Ginzberg (Short stories, Religion, Myths/Legends)\n\nRabbi Louis Ginzberg was one of the outstanding Talmudists of the twentieth century. He was born on November 28, 1873, in Kovno, Lithuania; he died on November 11, 1953, in New York City. Ginzberg taught at the Jewish Theological seminary from 1903 to 1953. For 50 years, he trained two generations of Conservative Rabbis.\n\nThe Legends of the Jews is an epic 7-volume compilation of traditional Jewish stories loosely related to the Bible. Volumes 1-4 contain the stories, while volumes 5-7 contain Ginzberg&#8217;s notes and commentary. Over the millenia, these stories, which expand on the Bible, flesh out the lives of biblical figures. In the process, they help bring to life the Bible&#8217;s valuable lessons.\n\nThe Legends of the Jews has been called a monumental work of scholarship. It is studied by serious students of both Judaism and Christianity. And yet the stories continue to be accessible and understood by all. They were designed to impart lessons of the Torah, and any child or adult will find much to enjoy about this work.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Is Mars Habitable? by Alfred Russel Wallace (Science, Essay/Short nonfiction)\n\nIn 1907 Wallace wrote the short book Is Mars Habitable? to criticize the claims made by Percival Lowell that there were Martian canals built by intelligent beings. Wallace did months of research, consulted various experts, and produced his own scientific analysis of the Martian climate and atmospheric conditions. Among other things Wallace pointed out that spectroscopic analysis had shown no signs of water vapor in the Martian atmosphere, that Lowell&#8217;s analysis of Mars&#8217; climate was seriously flawed and badly overestimated the surface temperature, and that low atmospheric pressure would make liquid water, let alone a planet girding irrigation system, impossible. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "La Contessa di Karolystria by Antonio Ghislanzoni (Comedy)\nLanguage: Italian\n\nAntonio Ghislanzoni, nato a Barco di Maggianico (Lecco) il 25 novembre 1824, &#232; meglio noto come autore di numerosissimi libretti per opere liriche tra cui &#8220;Aida&#8221; e &#8220;La forza del destino&#8221; di Giuseppe Verdi. Personalit&#224; eclettica: baritono egli stesso fino al 1856, nonch&#233; ex seminarista cacciato per cattiva condotta, stimolato dalle idee di Mazzini, nel 1848 dirige a Milano diversi giornali repubblicani; a causa delle sue idee fu anche arrestato dai francesi e brevemente detenuto in Corsica. Muore a Caprino Bergamasco il 16 luglio 1893.\n\n&#8220;La contessa di Karolystria&#8221; &#232; definito dallo stesso autore &#8220;il pi&#249; balzano, il pi&#249; strampalato de&#8217; miei racconti&#8221;, e in effetti altro non &#232; che una storia divertente piena di colpi di scena senza pretesa di avere &#8220;messaggi&#8221; da trasmettere. La trama &#232; presto detta: il visconte d&#8217;Aguilar -personaggio in cui potremmo scorgere lo stesso autore- si lascia coinvolgere nel turbine di avventure in cui viene trascinato per soccorrere la contessa di Karolystria e brillantemente, tra mille peripezie, riesce cavarla dai guai e ad aprirle un nuovo futuro.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Revelation of Baha-ullah in a Sequence of Four Lessons by Isabella Matilda Davis Brittingham (Literature)\n\nIsabella Matilda Davis Brittingham was a significant early American Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; and was posthumously designated by Shoghi Effendi as one of the 19 Disciples of &#8216;Abdu&#8217;l-Bah&#225; and Heralds of the Covenant. She was born in 1852, the daughter of Benjamin Davis, who was a grandson of John Morton, a signer of the Declaration of Independence. Her sister-in-law heard about the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; Faith in 1897 and in 1898 Isabella herself became a part of the nascent American Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; community. In September 1901, Isabella went on pilgrimage to the Holy Land, where she met &#8216;Abdu&#8217;l-Bah&#225;, the leader of the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; Faith and son of the Founder, Bah&#225;&#8217;u&apos;ll&#225;h. She used the knowledge she gained there to write &#8220;The Revelation of Baha-ullah in a Sequence of Four Lessons&#8221;, which was published by the Bahai Publishing Society of Chicago in 1902. There were nine editions of this work, the last being in 1920. It was one of the earliest accurate accounts of the Bah&#225;&#8217;&#237; Faith published in the West. The main purpose of the book is to demonstrate the truth of Bah&#225;&#8217;u&apos;ll&#225;h&#8217;s Revelation through Biblical prophecy.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

A man is horribly murdered in his bedroom, the door locked and bolted on the inside. Scotland Yard is stumped. Yet the seemingly unsolvable case has, as Inspector Grodman says, &#8220;one sublimely simple solution&#8221; that is revealed in a final chapter full of revelations and a shocking denouement. Detective fiction afficionados will be happy to learn that all the evidence to solve the case is provided. One of the earliest &#8220;locked room&#8221; mystery stories, The Big Bow Mystery is also a satire of late Victorian society.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

It tells the story of Zadig, a philosopher in ancient Babylonia. The author does not attempt any historical accuracy, and some of the problems Zadig faces are thinly disguised references to social and political problems of Voltaire&#226;&#128;&#153;s own day.\n\nThe book is philosophical in nature, and presents human life as in the hands of a destiny beyond human control. It is a story of religious and metaphysical orthodoxy, both of which Voltaire challenges with his presentation of the moral revolution taking place in Zadig himself. Voltaire&#226;&#128;&#153;s skillful use of the literary devices of contradiction and juxtaposition are shown in beautiful form in this prose.

It is usually described as one of Tolstoy&#8217;s two major masterpieces (the other being Anna Karenina) as well as one of the world&#8217;s greatest novels.\n\nWar and Peace offered a new kind of fiction, with a great many characters caught up in a plot that covered nothing less than the grand subjects indicated by the title, combined with the equally large topics of youth, age and marriage. While today it is considered a novel, it broke so many novelistic conventions of its day that many critics of Tolstoy&#8217;s time did not consider it as such. Tolstoy himself considered Anna Karenina (1878) to be his first attempt at a novel in the European sense. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Millionaerens Pilegrimsfaerd by Otto Martin Moller (Fiction)\nLanguage: Danish\n\nHvad nu om man kunne g&#248;re sit liv om &#8211; eller i det mindste bare gennemleve sin ungdom en gang til? M&#229;ske kr&#230;ver dette hverken mirakler, opstandelse eller genf&#248;dsel, men blot at man beslutter at g&#248;re det &#8211; at man beslutter sig for at g&#229; tilbage til hvor den svundne tid to sin begyndelse og starter forfra. Det er i hvert fald hvad romanens hovedperson Niels Faber s&#230;tter sig for. Million&#230;rens Pilegrimsf&#230;rd er en roman, der til trods for at den blev skrevet for mere end hundrede &#229;r siden, stadig er aktuel for ethvert menneske som p&#229; et tidspunkt i tilv&#230;relsen har skuet tilbage og t&#230;nkt den tanke at livet kunne have formet sig anderledes. Romanen er forfatterens sidste. Otto M. M&#248;ller d&#248;de i en alder af otteogtredive &#229;r. Forfatteren skrev den mens han var d&#248;ende og han havde formentlig en forudanelse af hvad der ventede ham. M&#229;ske derfor rummer dele af fort&#230;llingen nogen bitterhed. Romanen rummer dog ogs&#229; en hyldest til verdens sk&#248;nhed, den dejlige natur og til det &#230;rlige j&#230;vne menneske. I dag, i det enogtyvende &#229;rhundrede, kan vi derudover gl&#230;de os over at bogen giver et sj&#230;ldent godt &#248;jebliksbillede af det almindelige menneskes hverdagsliv i Danmark omkring 1890&#8242;erne. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
