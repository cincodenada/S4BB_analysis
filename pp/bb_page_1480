         "description" : "Little Wizard Stories of Oz by L. Frank Baum (1856-1919) (Children)\n\nThe &#8220;Little Wizard Stories of Oz&#8221; are six short stories written by L. Frank Baum in 1913. By all accounts, Baum intended to finish the Oz series with &#8220;The Emerald City of Oz,&#8221; published in 1910. Following that, he attempted to write non-Oz books, publishing &#8220;The Sea Fairies&#8221; in 1911 and &#8220;Sky Island&#8221; in 1912. But, (as Baum himself laments in the prefaces of many of his Oz books,) his &#8220;little tyrants&#8221; were only interested in hearing more Oz stories. So in 1913, he returned to writing about Oz, putting out both The &#8220;Little Wizard Stories&#8221; and &#8220;The Patchwork Girl of Oz&#8221; that year.\n\nAccording to this comprehensive Oz FAQ site, The Little Wizard Stories were geared toward younger children and were originally published separately, &#8220;similar in style to today&#8217;s Little Golden Books.&#8221; The next year, they were published together as one volume.\n\nEach Little Wizard Story revolves around the adventures of two famous Oz characters, and their humorous adventures in and around the land of Oz.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.The source of the audio content is in the public domain.

         "description" : "Love Conquers All by Robert Benchley (1889-1945) (Comedy)\n\nRobert Benchley, 1889-1945, was a writer, humorist and actor of note during the 1920s through the early 1940s. Born in Massachusetts, he spent his early literary career in New York City as an editor, critic and columnist for many of the major magazines of the day.\n\nAlong with George Kaufman, Dorothy Parker and Harpo Marx, he was an original &#8220;member&#8221; of the Algonquin Round Table. His popularity led him to a side career in radio and film, which took him to California in his later years. Writers as diverse as James Thurber, Woody Allen and Dave Barry have credited Benchley as an influence.\n\nLove Conquers All, originally published in 1922 is the second collection (of fifteen) gathering together Benchley&#8217;s humorous essays and reviews. Some references are dated, of course, but the surreal and mundane targets of Benchley&#8217;s wit will be familiar to everyone. This volume collects 63 excellent gems from his early professional work, when Benchley&#8217;s enthusiasm and style were approaching their peak.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.The source of the audio content is in the public domain.

         "description" : "Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz by L. Frank Baum (1856-1919) (Children)\n\nDorothy and the Wizard in Oz was the fourth of 14 Oz books written by L. Frank Baum (1856-1919). Published in 1908, while Baum was resident in Coronado, California, it is considered one of the &#8220;darker&#8221; of the Oz tales. However, it also is enlivened by Baum&#8217;s considerable wit, penchant for puns, and dry social commentary. In this title, Dorothy, her kitten Eureka, Jim, a cab horse, and Zeb, a ranch hand, descend into the earth through a rift opened by an earthquake. There they encounter the &#8220;humbug&#8221; wizard who once ruled Oz. In their journey back to the earth&#8217;s surface, they meet a number of potentially dangerous magical peoples and creatures including the cold-blooded Mangaboos, invisible bears, the flying wooden Gargoyles, a den of dragonettes, and an eccentric inventor. With a little help from Ozma, the group end up in Oz where they are treated to feasts and celebrations. The animals end up humbled by a few of their experiences in Oz, where all animals can talk, and return home a little wiser.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.The source of the audio content is in the public domain.

         "description" : "The Diary of a Nobody by George Grossmith (1847-1912) and Weedon Grossmith (1852-1919). (Comedy)\n\nThe Diary of a Nobody is the fictitious record of fifteen months in the life of Charles Pooter, his family, friends and small circle of acquaintances. It first appeared, serialised in Punch magazine and might be regarded as the first &#8216;blog&#8217;; being a record of the simplicities and humiliations in the life of this mundane, but upright, city clerk, who had an incontestable faith that a record of his daily life was worth preserving for posterity.\nSet in about 1891 in Holloway, which was then a typical suburb of the impecuniously respectable kind, the authors contrive a record of the manners, customs and experiences of the late Victorian era. The bare record of facts, simply recorded, manages to be humorous rather than dull, no doubt because of the usual occupations of the authors.\nGeorge Grossmith (1847-1912) was an actor and comedian.\nWeedon Grossmith (1852-1919) was an entertainer and illustrated the original work.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.The source of the audio content is in the public domain.

Her narrative was constructed partly as a response to the glowing falsehoods European land-agents were circulating about life in the New World. Her chronicle is frank and humorous, and was a popular sensation at the time of its publication in 1852. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Poems of Gerard Manley Hopkins by Gerard Manley Hopkins and Robert Bridges (Poetry)\n\nGerard Manley Hopkins (1844&#8211;89) was an English poet, educated at Oxford. Entering the Roman Catholic Church in 1866 and the Jesuit novitiate in 1868, he was ordained in 1877. Upon becoming a Jesuit he burned much of his early verse and abandoned the writing of poetry. However, the sinking in 1875 of a German ship carrying five Franciscan nuns, exiles from Germany, inspired him to write one of his most impressive poems &#8220;The Wreck of the Deutschland.&#8221; Thereafter he produced his best poetry, including &#8220;God&#8217;s Grandeur,&#8221; &#8220;The Windhover,&#8221; &#8220;The Leaden Echo,&#8221; and &#8220;The Golden Echo.&#8221;\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Henry short story in which a young couple are very much in love with each other but can barely afford their one-room apartment. For Christmas, they each make a sacrifice to purchase a gift for the other, with ironic results.\n\nThe moral of the story is that physical possessions, however valuable they may be, are of little value in the grand scheme of things. The true unselfish love that the characters, Jim and Della, share is greater than their possessions.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Along the way, Pomona tangles with wild pigs, haymaking, hotels great and small, Pullman cars, comparison-makers, and a Duchess. She makes two matches and &#8211; in her usual, unorthodox way &#8211; stag hunts and attends a knighting. Pomona is as hilarious as ever, if a bit more rounded off on the edges.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
