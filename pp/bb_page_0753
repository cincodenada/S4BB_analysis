         "description" : "Peace On Earth, Good-Will To Dogs by Eleanor Hallowell Abbott (Holiday, Children, Animals)\n\n&#8220;If you don&#8217;t like Christmas stories, don&#8217;t read this one!\n\n\nAnd if you don&#8217;t like dogs I don&#8217;t know just what to advise you to do!\n\n\nFor I warn you perfectly frankly that I am distinctly pro-dog and distinctly pro-Christmas, and would like to bring to this little story whatever whiff of fir-balsam I can cajole from the make-believe forest in my typewriter, and every glitter of tinsel, smudge of toy candle, crackle of wrapping paper, that my particular brand of brain and ink can conjure up on a single keyboard! And very large-sized dogs shall romp through every page! And the mercury shiver perpetually in the vicinity of zero! And every foot of earth be crusty-brown and bare with no white snow at all till the very last moment when you&#8217;d just about given up hope! And all the heart of the story is very,&#8212;oh very young!\n\n\nFor purposes of propriety and general historical authenticity there are of course parents in the story. And one or two other oldish persons. But they all go away just as early in the narrative as I can manage it.&#8212;Are obliged to go away!\n\nYet lest you find in this general combination of circumstances some sinister threat of audacity, let me conventionalize the story at once by opening it at that most conventional of all conventional Christmas-story hours,&#8212;the Twilight of Christmas Eve.&#8221; (excerpt from the text)\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Gospel According to St. Luke by American Standard Version (Religion)\n\nThe Gospel of Luke is a synoptic Gospel, and the third and longest of the four canonical Gospels of the New Testament. The text narrates the life of Jesus, with particular interest concerning his birth, ministry, death, and resurrection; and it ends with an account of the ascension. The author is characteristically concerned with social ethics, the poor, women, and other oppressed groups. Certain well-loved stories on these themes, such as the prodigal son and the good Samaritan, are found only in this gospel. The Gospel also has a special emphasis on prayer, the activity of the Holy Spirit, and joyfulness. D. Guthrie stated, &#8220;it is full of superb stories and leaves the reader with a deep impression of the personality and teachings of Jesus.&#8221;\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Hans Brinker by Mary Mapes Dodge (Children)\n\nMary Mapes Dodge created an instant bestseller with &#8220;Hans Brinker or The Silver Skates.&#8221; She wanted the book to be partly a book of travels and partly a domestic story. It is a tale written for children that adults also find interesting and uplifting. Dodge writes as if she is sending a series of letters from Holland to children in America, and her you-are-there perspective is aided by a nice attention to detail and vivid imagery.\n\nThe Brinkers are a poor but stoic family under a dark cloud &#8211; Raff, the man of the house, fell from the dikes while reinforcing them during a bad storm, and for ten years he has been in a vegetative state. With no steady income, the family&#8217;s lot is grinding poverty. Despite their unfortunate circumstances, Hans and Gretel are cheerful children, yet always attentive to the needs of their mother and their present-but-not-really-there father. Their social standing is very low, but they both attract firm friends, even among the gentry, for their honesty, industry, and good-heartedness.\n\nThen a glorious skating race is proposed for the town of Broek, with the prize a pair of silver skates for both the winning boy and girl. In the weeks leading up to the race, we follow the adventures of five of the local boys who are showing a visiting relative from England the sights of the Netherlands. Hans improbably meets the one man who might be able to heal his father, and somehow Hans finds a way to afford some skates so that he and Gretel can enter the race.\n\nThis all leads up to a dramatic, moving, and entirely satisfactory conclusion. &#8220;Hans Brinker&#8221; hits a series of high notes and encourages children to cultivate and display their finer qualities.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

It is usually described as one of Tolstoy&#8217;s two major masterpieces (the other being Anna Karenina) as well as one of the world&#8217;s greatest novels.\n\n\nWar and Peace offered a new kind of fiction, with a great many characters caught up in a plot that covered nothing less than the grand subjects indicated by the title, combined with the equally large topics of youth, age and marriage. While today it is considered a novel, it broke so many novelistic conventions of its day that many critics of Tolstoy&#8217;s time did not consider it as such. Tolstoy himself considered Anna Karenina (1878) to be his first attempt at a novel in the European sense.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "War and Peace, Book 06: 1808-1810 by Leo Tolstoy (War stories, Romance)\n\nTranslated by Louise Shanks Maude and Aylmer Maude.\n\nWar and Peace (Russian: &#1042;&#1086;&#1081;&#1085;&#1072; &#1080; &#1084;&#1080;&#1088;, Voyna i mir; in original orthography: &#1042;&#1086;&#1081;&#1085;&#1072; &#1080; &#1084;&#1080;&#1088;&#1098;, Voyna i mir&#8221;) is an epic novel by Leo Tolstoy, first published from 1865 to 1869 in Russki Vestnik, which tells the story of Russian society during the Napoleonic Era. It is usually described as one of Tolstoy&#8217;s two major masterpieces (the other being Anna Karenina) as well as one of the world&#8217;s greatest novels.\n\nWar and Peace offered a new kind of fiction, with a great many characters caught up in a plot that covered nothing less than the grand subjects indicated by the title, combined with the equally large topics of youth, age and marriage. While today it is considered a novel, it broke so many novelistic conventions of its day that many critics of Tolstoy&#8217;s time did not consider it as such. Tolstoy himself considered Anna Karenina (1878) to be his first attempt at a novel in the European sense. \n\nNote: The novel is split up in 15 books. This is the recording of book six, which covers events in the year 1808-1810.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Tale Of Daddy Long Legs by Arthur Scott Bailey (Children, Fiction)\n\nArthur Scott Bailey (1877 &#8211; 1949) was author of more than forty children&#8217;s books. He was born on November 15, 1877, in St. Albans, Vermont, United States, the second child of Winfield Scott Bailey and Harriet Sarah Goodhue.\n\nTHERE was great excitement in the neighborhood of Farmer Green&#8217;s house. Rusty Wren had found some strange tracks. And nobody knew whose they were.\n\nNow, when they were puzzled like that the field- and forest-folk usually went straight to Mr. Crow for advice. But this time it happened that the old gentleman had gone on an excursion to the further side of Blue Mountain, where Brownie Beaver lived. And there seemed to be no one else at hand who was likely to be able to explain the mystery. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Book 3 begins with a wealth of biblical scholarship, directed at establishing the authority of Scripture while at the same time undermining modern claims to supernatural revelation that would subvert civil law. Hobbes concludes that we cannot be sure of anyone else&#8217;s divine revelation, and that religious authority is therefore subordinate to civil power. Book 4, titled &#8220;Of the Kingdom of Darkness,&#8221; sets forth the various ways in which Scripture has been misinterpreted by the church, according to Hobbes, in mixing pagan elements with Christianity.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

However, when the murders of young women in London attributed to a man known only as &#8220;The Avenger&#8221; continue, the Buntings, particularly Mrs. Bunting, grow fearful that their lodger may be the murderer.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
