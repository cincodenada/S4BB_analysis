         "description" : "Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe (Adventure)\n\nDaniel Defoe&#8217;s The Life and Strange Surprizing Adventures of Robinson Crusoe of York, Mariner (1719) is considered by many the first English novel. Based on the real-life experiences of the castaway Alexander Selkirk, the book has had a perennial appeal among readers of all ages-&#8211;especially the young adult reading public&#8211;-who continue to find inspiration in the inventive resourcefulness of its hero, sole survivor of a shipwreck who is marooned on an uninhabited island.\n\nEspecially poignant, after more than two decades of unbroken solitude, is the affection that Robinson develops for Friday, another survivor fleeing certain death at the hands of enemy tribesmen from the South American continent.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Among the Stoics of the Greek and Roman world were its founder, Zeno, the former slave Epictetus, and the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius. George Stock discusses not only the Stoic ethics, but also less well-known aspects of Stoicism, such as its division of the branches of philosophy, its account of logic, and its natural philosophy.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood by Howard Pyle (Children, Adventure, Teen/Young adult, Historical Fiction)\n\nRobin Hood is the archetypal English folk hero; a courteous, pious and swashbuckling outlaw of the medi&#230;val era who, in modern versions of the legend, is famous for robbing the rich to feed the poor and fighting against injustice and tyranny. He operates with his &#8220;seven score&#8221; (140 strong) group of fellow outlawed yeomen &#8211; named the Merry Men. He and his band are usually associated with Sherwood Forest, Nottinghamshire.\n\nThe Victorian era generated its own distinct versions of Robin Hood. The traditional tales were often adapted for children, most notably in Howard Pyle&#8217;s Merry Adventures of Robin Hood. These versions firmly stamp Robin as a staunch philanthropist, a man who takes from the rich to give to the poor.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

He originally planned to have his memoirs published only after his death but realized, once he&#8217;d passed his 70th year, that a lot of the material might be OK to publish before his departure. These chapters were published in serial form in the North American Review during 1906-1907. While much of the material consists of stories about the people, places and incidents of his long life, there&#8217;re also several sections from his daughter, which he calls &#8220;Susy&#8217;s biography of me&#8221;.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
