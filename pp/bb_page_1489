         "description" : "Spurgeon&apos;s Sermons May 1858 by Charles Spurgeon (Religion)\n\nCharles Spurgeon was a popular Baptist minister in London in mid-Victorian times; his ministry was highly influential and had a significant effect on many families in London and further afield. It was difficult to find a hall large enough to accommodate the crowd who wished to hear him. At times the Royal Surrey Gardens&#8217; Music Hall was hired to accomodate the Sunday congregation; this could seat 10,000 but large numbers were unable to gain admittance.\n\nHis world-wide heritage is very much with us today through the many chuches built, missionary work begun, children&#8217;s charity founded and theological colleges established as a result of his ministry.\n\nThe sermons in this collection were preached buring May 1898 and published immediately at one penny (1d.) each. These were widely circulated and remain one of the all-time best-selling series of writings.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

The secret for fast interstellar travel though is still tightly kept by the alien race Lhari. An agreement between humans and Lhari has been made that permits humans only to travel in cold sleep as passengers aboard Lhari vessels as to not reveal the secret.\n\nSome humans &#8211; the Mentorians &#8211; have had a slight genetic shift which enhanced their vision to withstand the light levels that the aliens Lhari use and live in. Mentorians perceive a wider optical spectrum than ordinary humans &#8211; some can see the &#8216;eighth color&#8217;. Mentorians act as translators, middleman and interpreters between the two races. But their ability sets them apart from the rest of humanity. Bart, half Mentorian, has this ability.\n\nBart, surgically altering his appearance to hire as a Lhari on a homeworld bound Lhari vessel, attempts to steal the secret of the Warp Drive &#8211; an attempt on which countless humans spies have failed before. \n\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Machine Stops by E. M. Forster (Science fiction)\n\nThe Machine Stops is a short science fiction story. It describes a world in which almost all humans have lost the ability to live on the surface of the Earth. Each individual lives in isolation in a &#8216;cell&#8217;, with all bodily and spiritual needs met by the omnipotent, global Machine. Most humans welcome this development, as they are skeptical and fearful of first-hand experience. People forget that humans created the Machine, and treat it as a mystical entity whose needs supersede their own. Those who do not accept the deity of the Machine are viewed as &#8216;unmechanical&#8217; and are threatened with &#8220;Homelessness&#8221;. Eventually, the Machine apocalyptically collapses, and the civilization of the Machine comes to an end. (Wikipedia)\n\nComment by book coordinator:\nA condensed rapidfire of details and ideas imagining a dystopian world. Good thing he made it a short story. And the world he describes feels so appalling, although we are good on the way to be where Forster imagined us &#8211; shocker. So imaginative for 1909! Staying at home with the telly and internet and instant messaging and videoconferencing, google and pizza delivery and all flats and all cities look alike. And the loss of Patience! Damn this is good and so true &#8211; with one big exception the many buttons for all the machines functions. But how would Forster know of digital interfaces? That would have been too much to foresee.\n\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "In Defense of Women by H. L. Mencken (philosophy)\n\nIn Defense of Women is H. L. Mencken&#8217;s 1918 book on women and the relationship between the sexes. Some laud the book as progressive while others brand it as reactionary. While Mencken didn&#8217;t champion women&#8217;s rights, he described women as wiser in many novel and observable ways, while demeaning average men. According to Mencken&#8217;s biographer, Fred Hobson: Depending on the position of the reader, he was either a great defender of women&#8217;s rights or, as a critic labelled him in 1916, &#8216;the greatest misogynist since Schopenhauer&#8217;,&apos;the country&#8217;s high-priest of woman-haters.\n\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

It is included in the Ten-gyur, &#3908;&#3964;&#3851; section, volume &#3906;&#3964;&#3851;, beginning at leaf 165. The Tibetan translator describes it as the second volume but I cannot say whether the remainder of the work has been preserved in Tibetan &#8211; the Sanscrit original is apparently lost.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Cricket on the Hearth by Charles Dickens (Holiday, Literature)\n\nJohn Peerybingle, a carrier, lives with his wife Dot (who is much younger than he), their baby, their nanny Tilly Slowboy, and a mysterious lodger. A cricket constantly chirps on the hearth and acts as a guardian angel to the family, at one point assuming a human voice to warn John that his suspicions that Dot is having an affair with the lodger are wrong.\n\nThe life of the Peerybingles frequently intersects with that of Caleb Plummer, a poor toymaker employed by the miser Mr. Tackleton. Caleb has a blind daughter Bertha and a son Edward, who travelled to South America and seemingly never returned.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Published serially in 1862, it tells the story of the lovely Lucy Graham, who becomes Lady Audley at the beginning of the novel, and who conceals a scandalous secret from her new husband and his family. The plot, which includes madness, bigamy, attempted murder, and seduction, made this a shocking but highly successful story for Victorian audiences. It remains one of the best examples of 19th century sensational fiction, and is a wonderfully absorbing book. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Book of Tea by Okakura Kakuzo (Philosophy, History)\n\nThe Book of Tea was written by Okakura Kakuzo in the early 20th century. It was first published in 1906, and has since been republished many times. &#8211; In the book, Kakuzo introduces the term Teaism and how Tea has affected nearly every aspect of Japanese culture, thought, and life. The book is noted to be accessibile to Western audiences because though Kakuzo was born and raised Japanese, he was trained from a young age to speak English; and would speak it all his life, becoming proficient at communicating his thoughts in the Western Mind. In his book he elucidates such topics as Zen and Taoism, but also the secular aspects of Tea and Japanese life. The book emphasises how Teaism taught the Japanese many things; most importantly, simplicity. Kakuzo argues that this tea-induced simplicity affected art and architecture, and he was a long-time student of the visual arts. He ends the book with a chapter on Tea Masters, and spends some time talking about Sen no Rikyu and his contribution to the Japanese Tea Ceremony.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

The novel is told using a series of flashbacks in non-chronological order, a literary technique pioneered by Ford. It also makes use of the device of the unreliable narrator, as the main character gradually reveals a version of events that is quite different from what the introduction leads you to believe. The novel was loosely based on two incidents of adultery and on Ford&apos;s messy personal life.&#8221; \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Middlemarch by George Eliot (Literature)\n\nThe book examines the role of education in the lives of the characters and how such education and study has affected the characters. Rosamond Vincy&#8217;s finishing school education is a foil to Dorothea Brooke&#8217;s religiously-motivated quest for knowledge. Rosamond initially admires Lydgate for his exotic education, and his intellect. A similar dynamic is present in Dorothea and Casaubon&#8217;s relationship, with Dorothea revering her new husband&#8217;s intellect and eloquence. In both cases, however, the young wives&#8217; expectations of their husbands intellects are not reflected in reality.\n\nDespite extreme erudition, Mr. Casaubon is afraid to publish because he believes that he must write a work that is utterly above criticism. In contrast, Lydgate at times arrogantly flaunts his knowledge, making enemies with his fellow physicians. He regards the residents of Middlemarch with a certain amount of contempt stemming from his belief that the townspeople are backwards and uninteresting. However, his education has not included tact and politicking, skills necessary in a small town but are seen by Lydgate as below him, the brilliant doctor.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Die Elixiere des Teufels by E.T.A. Hoffmann (Horror/Ghost stories, Mystery) (German)\n\nDer Bruder Medardus ist ein hoch angesehenes, f&#252;r seine feurigen Predigten bekanntes Mitglied der Klostergemeinde. Als ihm die Aufsicht &#252;ber die Reliquienkammer &#252;bertragen wird, beginnt jedoch sein Niedergang. Unter den Sch&#228;tzen befindet sich auch eine Flasche der Elixiere des Teufels, mit denen der Satan vor Jahrhunderten den heiligen Antonius verf&#252;hren wollte. Ein Schluck aus der Flasche besiegelt seinen Abstieg. Obgleich seine Predigten feuriger denn je werden, verliert er sich in Selbstverliebtheit und entsagt so dem G&#246;ttlichen.\n\nIn der Hoffnung, Medardus&#8217; Seele zu retten schickt ihn der Prior des Klosters auf die Reise nach Rom. Einmal frei von den Mauern des Klosters, beginnt Medardus Kampf gegen den den Verf&#252;hrer. Seine Reise ist gegpr&#228;gt von L&#252;gen, Diebstahl und Mord. Immer wieder begegnet er Personen, die ihm erstaunlich &#228;hnlich sind. In diesen findet er all seine Schw&#228;chen wieder, er schl&#252;pft in ihre Rollen, versucht ihr Leben und findet letztlich doch wieder zu sich selbst zur&#252;ck.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
