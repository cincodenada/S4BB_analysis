Cut off from the comforts and companionship of other humans, they use a familiarity with natural history and biology to find the resources and build the tools to construct a canoe, weave cloth, irrigate a garden, and turn an immense hollow tree into a lofty house with a spiral staircase. They domesticate buffaloes, wild asses, and monkeys. They establish farms and plantations. And finally, they have a terrifying encounter with natives from a nearby island.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Innocents Abroad by Mark Twain (Adventure, Memoirs)\n\nWhen you dive into Mark Twain&#8217;s (Samuel Clemens&#8217;) The Innocents Abroad, you have to be ready to learn more about the unadorned, ungilded reality of 19th century &#8220;touring&#8221; than you might think you want to learn. This is a tough, literary journey. It was tough for Twain and his fellow &#8220;pilgrims&#8221;, both religious and otherwise. They set out, on a June day in 1867, to visit major tourist sites in Europe and the near east, including Greece, Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, &#8220;the Holy Land&#8221;, and Egypt. What Twain records, in often humorous, sometimes grotesque but always fascinating detail, are the day-to-day ups and downs of discovering the truth about people and places. The truths they learn are often far different than their education and rumor have made them preconceive.\n\nThis is a voyage of discovery. It&#8217;s long and, in places, tiresome. But it&#8217;s revelatory about so much. As with some of his other works, Twain includes popular prejudices of his time, which are today considered socially unacceptable. His references to &#8220;Indians&#8221;, &#8220;Negroes&#8221; and &#8220;infidels&#8221; come to mind.\n\nBeyond the lows, though, there are the highs of Twain&#8217;s cutting wit and insight as he guides us along the bumpy and often dangerous voyage. No need to buckle up. Just take it slow, and steady&#8230;like the journey itself.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Chambers (1865-1933) studied art in Paris in the late 80&#8217;s and early 90&#8217;s, where his work was displayed at the Salon. However, shortly after returning to America, he decided to spend his time in writing. He became popular as the writer of a number of romantic novels, but is now best known as the author of &#8220;The King In Yellow&#8221;. This is a collection of the first half of this work of short stories which have an eerie, other-worldly feel to it.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow by Washington Irving (Mystery)\n\nThe quiet Dutch community of Sleepy Hollow lay in the Adirondack mountains on the western shore of the mighty Hudson River in America&#8217;s colonial period. The solitude of the woods was breathtaking, and not even a schoolmaster was immune from the eerie miasma which everyone knew permeated the dense forest. Written in 1820, Washington Irving&#8217;s The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow has become a classic of American literature, and has been retold in many different ways. Here is the original, from Irving&#8217;s own hand. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

It was thought to have been sold to the publisher for &#163;60 on Oliver Goldsmith&#8217;s behalf by Dr Johnson to enable Goldsmith to pay off outstanding rent and to release himself from his landlady&#8217;s arrest.\n\nIt is the story of the family of Dr Primrose, a benevolent vicar, and follows them through their fall from fortune and their ultimate rise again.

Children coming home from school stop to stare at him as he works, impressed by the roaring bellows and burning sparks. On Sundays, the blacksmith, a single father after the death of his wife, takes his children to church, where his daughter sings in the choir. He goes through his life following the daily tasks assigned to him and has earned his sleep at night.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The War of the Worlds by H. G. Wells (Science Fiction)\n\nH. G. Wells wrote The War of the Worlds in 1898, when there was much speculation about life on the planet Mars. The book is considered to be one of the first science fiction novels. In the story, an English gentleman narrates the events of a violent and fast paced Martian invasion.\n\nThe frightening images of people fleeing from gigantic tripod machines and the prospect of life under Martian rule have served as a bottomless well of inspiration for popular culture. The novel has served as a template for many derivative or inspired works, including comics, countless books, a tv series, several films, a bestselling musical, and the famous Orson Wells broadcast. Overall, The War of the Worlds has become an early milestone in and inspiration for the invasion genre.\n\nThe novel demonstrates Wells&#8217; typical pessimistic outlook on human nature and offers a good deal of critisism on society and people&#8217;s ignorance and vanity. The War of the Worlds can be read as an indictment of European colonial actions around the globe at that time &#8211; with which the injustice of the Martian invasion can be compared. Wells has since been credited with predicting quite a number of technologies, such as laser-like rays, industrial robot-like machines, and chemical-warfare.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Warden by Anthony Trollope (Literature)\n\nAmongst the great popular novelists of the nineteenth century who are still read today, Anthony Trollope stands alongside his contemporary, Charles Dickens. His two series of novels, the political (The Pallisers) and the clerical (The Barsetshire Chronicles) are the best known. This book is the first of the Barsetshire series and was also Trollope&#8217;s first really successful novel.\n\nIn the mid nineteenth century there were a number of financial scandals in the Church of England including those of Rochester, where the endowments which should have supported the King&#8217;s School Canterbury had been diverted to the Dean and Chapter; and of the hospital of St Cross at Winchester where the Rev. Francis North, later the Earl of Guildford, had been appointed to the mastership of the hospital by his father the bishop. The revenues of the hospital were very considerable, the work involved minimal. The scandal soon broke.\n\nTrollope based &#8216;The Warden&#8217; on the St Cross case, but in the novel the Warden is a kindly, devoted, priest, beloved by all that knew him and is racked by fear that he is accepting money to which he is not entitled. His antagonist is his prospective son-in-law John Bold and his (somewhat unwelcome) ally is one of Trollope&#8217;s strongest characters, the Archdeacon of Barchester, Dr. Theophilus Grantly. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Reviews by Oscar Wide (Essay)\n\nWilde&#8217;s literary reputation has survived so much that I think it proof against any exhumation of articles which he or his admirers would have preferred to forget. As a matter of fact, I believe this volume will prove of unusual interest; some of the reviews are curiously prophetic; some are, of course, biassed by prejudice hostile or friendly; others are conceived in the author&#8217;s wittiest and happiest vein; only a few are colourless. And if, according to Lord Beaconsfield, the verdict of a continental nation may be regarded as that of posterity, Wilde is a much greater force in our literature than even friendly contemporaries ever supposed he would become.\n\nIt should be remembered, however, that at the time when most of these reviews were written Wilde had published scarcely any of the works by which his name has become famous in Europe, though the protagonist of the &#230;sthetic movement was a well-known figure in Paris and London.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Waste Land by T. S. Eliot (Poetry)\n\nThe Waste Land is a highly influential 433-line modernist poem by T. S. Eliot. It is perhaps the most famous and most written-about long poem of the 20th century, dealing with the decline of civilization and the impossibility of recovering meaning in life. Despite the alleged obscurity of the poem&#8212;its shifts between satire and prophecy, its abrupt and unannounced changes of speaker, location and time, its elegiac but intimidating summoning up of a vast and dissonant range of cultures and literatures&#8212;the poem has nonetheless become a familiar touchstone of modern literature. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Wisdom of Father Brown by G. K. Chesterton (Mystery)\n\nThis is the second of five books of short stories about G. K. Chesterton&#8217;s fictional detective, first published in 1914. Father Brown is a short, nondescript Catholic Priest with shapeless clothes and a large umbrella who has an uncanny insight into human evil. His methods, unlike those of his near contemporary Sherlock Holmes, although based on observation of details often unnoticed by others, tended to be intuitive rather than deductive. Although clearly devout, he always emphasizes rationality: despite his religiousness and his belief in God and miracles, he manages to see the perfectly ordinary, natural explanation of the problem. He is a devout, educated and &#8220;civilized&#8221; clergyman, who is totally familiar with contemporary and secular thought and behavior. His character was thought to be based on Father John O&#8217;Connor (1870 &#8211; 1952), a parish priest in Bradford, Yorkshire. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Vanity Fair by William Makepeace Thackeray (Satire)\n\nVanity Fair: A Novel without a Hero is a novel by William Makepeace Thackeray that satirizes society in early 19th-century England. \n\nThackeray meant the book to be not only entertaining but also instructive; this is shown both by the narrator of the book and in Thackeray&#8217;s private correspondence. The novel is now remembered as a classic of English literature, though some critics claim that it has structural problems; Thackeray sometimes lost track of the huge scope of his work, mixing up characters&#8217; names and minor plot details. The number of allusions and references it contains can make it difficult for modern readers to follow. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Work without Hope by Samuel Taylor Coleridge (Poetry)\n\nColeridge is one of the most important figures in English poetry. His poems directly and deeply influenced all the major poets of the age. He was known by his contemporaries as a meticulous craftsman who was more rigorous in his careful reworking of his poems than any other poet. As important as Coleridge was to poetry as a poet, he was equally important to poetry as a critic. Coleridge&apos;s philosophy of poetry, which he developed over many years, has been deeply influential in the field of literary criticism.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Every sentence sounds like a sort of revelation to an unprepared reader&#226;&#128;&#153;s mind and causes a deep flashback thoughts which are impossible to get rid of, which also require an immediate solution.\n\nThough it&#226;&#128;&#153;s hard to define precisely what kind of content presented in novel but one can say it is a sort of impossible mixture of traditional Dostoevsky&#226;&#128;&#153;s ideas of loneliness, ideas of internal human conflict, ideas of freedom and inter human relationship.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
