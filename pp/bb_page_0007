         "description" : "Written by one of America&apos;s greatest authors, Moby-Dick is a work of tremendous power and depth--one of world literature&apos;s great poetic epics. In the novel, published in 1851 after sixteen months of writing, Herman Melville recounts the Promethean quest of Captain Ahab, who, having lost a leg in a earlier battle with White Whale, is determined to catch the beast and destroy it. By the time readers meet Ahab, he is a vengeful, crazed, and terror-provoking figure, for Moby-Dick has come to represent for him all the evil in the world. \n\nThe relentless voyage of Ahab and his crew, a finely etched group of weird and wonderful characters who seem both flesh-and-blood individuals and symbolic of the varying qualities of men, becomes a masterful drama of life at sea. The drama is made more fascinating by Melville&apos;s eloquent style--a combination of the journalistic, colloquial, and poetic--and the themes and subjects he pursues--whales and whaling; man&apos;s need for love and comradeship; and the fury of Ahab for the whale. Through realistic storytelling, symbolic allegory, and allusive and figurative language, Melville achieves in Moby-Dick a special intensity that readers will marvel at, and not soon forget.\n\n+++ Ebook Reader included! +++\n\nEbook Reader Features: \n- High Quality Fonts for better Readability.\n- Multi-Bookmarking Support.\n- Multi-EBook Support.\n- Easy trackball and touch screen scrolling.\n- Reading Progress Indicator.\n- Hotkey Page Navigation: Top, Bottom, Page Up, Down.\n\nTroubleshooting:\nIf you encounter any troubles opening the ebook after installation, please try to restart your device (ALT+SHIFT+DEL or pull the battery).

Shelley started writing the story when she was 18 and the novel was published when she was 20. The first edition was published anonymously in London in 1818. Shelley&apos;s name appears on the second edition, published in 1831. \n\nThe title of the novel refers to a scientist, Victor Frankenstein, who learns how to create life and creates a being in the likeness of man, but larger than average and more powerful. In popular culture, people have tended incorrectly to refer to the monster as &quot;Frankenstein&quot;. Frankenstein is infused with some elements of the Gothic novel and the Romantic movement. It was also a warning against the expansion of modern man in the Industrial Revolution, alluded to in the novel&apos;s subtitle, The Modern Prometheus. The story has had an influence across literature and popular culture and spawned a complete genre of horror stories and films.\n\n+++ Ebook Reader included! +++\n\nEbook Reader Features: \n- High Quality Fonts for better Readability.\n- Multi-Bookmarking Support.\n- Multi-EBook Support.\n- Easy trackball and touch screen scrolling.\n- Reading Progress Indicator.\n- Hotkey Page Navigation: Top, Bottom, Page Up, Down.\n\nTroubleshooting:\nIf you encounter any troubles opening the ebook after installation, please try to restart your device (ALT+SHIFT+DEL or pull the battery).

It allows you to schedule your device to turn off and back on when you want.\n \nWhat PowerControl Does: \n\nPowerControl is a handy software that helps you automatically shutdown and power off at a scheduled time you specified. It allows you to set up a power off and on schedule from Monday to Sunday and you can even set up a different schedule for each day.\n \nBy shutting down the BlackBerry&#174; on regular basis, a lot of battery power can be saved!\n\nExample:\n\nImagine you work from Monday to Friday and every day you sleep 6 hours. In these 6 hours most people do not need the device to be switched on and waste battery. You could turn off the device before you go to bed, but this is hard to remember every single day. With PowerControl you will never forget to turn your BlackBerry&#174; off and back on. \n\nAnother example would be that you want to have the Wednesday lunch with your buddy without any interruption. Just set a PowerControl schedule to turn the device off every Wednesday at 1 pm and turn it back on at 2 pm. You have the break you deserve and you even save battery!\n\nCheck out PowerControl now! \n\nPlease leave a review if you like it.\n\n\nThis product comes with a 30 day value back guarantee.
