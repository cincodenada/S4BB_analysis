         "description" : "Guide your space craft through myriad of asteroids and reach the home planet as fast as you can before it runs out of gas. As you fly through, your half broken craft emits hazardous gases. Make sure you dont pass through those and fly wisely. Game play progress through various levels with more tighter play time.\n\nThere is 3 x 4 grid of numbers from 1 to 12 with a starting point A near 1 and and ending point B near 12. The user draws a line starting from A and goes through all the twelve numbers as instructed by the game and finally reaches point B. The challenge is that while drawing lines crossing numbers on the way, the line should not intersect with already drawn line, in which case the game gets over.\nTo state in other way, the player needs to draw a line without intersecting with itself, touching all the points as instructed by the game and reach the end point.\n\nDifficulty:\nThere will be 3 modes of difficulty: easy, medium and hard with grid sizes 3x3, 3x4 and 3x5 respectively. Within each mode, there will be several levels. As the levels progress, the timing will be tightened to increase the difficulty.\n\nTiming:\nPlayer needs to reach each number within the given time, once the number is reached additional time will be provided to reach the next number.\n\nScoring:\nScore will be awarded for each reach of a number, a separate timer for combo will be running. If the numbers are reached before that combo timer runs out, additional points will be given. Then at the end of level, the remaining time adds up to the score.",
