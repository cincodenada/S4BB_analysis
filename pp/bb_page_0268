         "description" : "Third Class in Indian Railways by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (Politics, History)\n\nMohandas Karamchand Gandhi (1869 &#8211; 1948) was the pre-eminent political and spiritual leader of India during the Indian independence movement. He was the pioneer of satyagraha &#8212; resistance to tyranny through mass civil disobedience. This philosophy was firmly founded upon ahimsa, or total nonviolence, and led India to independence and inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. Gandhi is commonly known around the world as Mahatma Gandhi and in India also as Bapu. He is officially honoured in India as the Father of the Nation; his birthday, 2 October, is commemorated there as Gandhi Jayanti, a national holiday. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Personal Recollections of Early Melbourne and Victoria \nby William Westgarth (History, Memoirs)\n\nSon of John Westgarth, surveyor-general of customs for Scotland, was born at Edinburgh, in June 1815. He was educated at the high schools at Leith and Edinburgh, and at Dr Bruce&#8217;s school at Newcastle-on-Tyne. He then entered the office of G. Young and Company of Leith, who were engaged in the Australian trade, and realizing the possibilities of the new land, decided to emigrate to Australia. He arrived in Melbourne, then a town of three or four thousand inhabitants, in December 1840.When the new colony was constituted Westgarth headed the poll for Melbourne at the election for the legislative council. He had had many activities during the previous 10 years.He revisited Australia in 1888 and was everywhere welcomed. When the Melbourne international exhibition was opened he walked in the procession through the avenue of nations alongside Mr Francis Henty, then the sole survivor of the brotherhood who founded Victoria. As a result of his visit two volumes appeared Personal Recollections of Early Melbourne and Victoria, in 1888, and Half a Century of Australasian Progress, in 1889. Returning to Great Britain Westgarth died suddenly at Edinburgh on 28 October 1889. He married in 1853 and left a widow and two daughters.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

(Memoirs, Psychology) (Dutch)\n\nSara Burgerhart is een jong meisje dat correspondeert met haar vriendinnen, aanbidders en familie. Die mensen schrijven elkaar ook allemaal. Het boek bestaat uit 175 brieven van 24 personages. Soms lichtvoetig, dan beschouwend. Sara streeft ernaar een goede burger te zijn, een eerlijk mens en een hartelijke vriendin. Ze zoekt haar eigen weg en probeert voor zichzelf denken. Dat is typisch voor de Verlichting, een tijdperk waarin niet langer de waarheden van kerk en overheid zonder meer voor waar aangenomen werden, maar de overtuiging post vatte dat je de waarheid zelf moet vinden met behulp van de ratio (de rede, het verstand).

         "description" : "A Study in Scarlet by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (Mystery, Fiction)\n\nA Study in Scarlet is a detective mystery novel written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, which was first published in 1887. It is the first story to feature the character of Sherlock Holmes, who would later become one of the most famous literary detective characters, with long-lasting interest and appeal. The book&apos;s title derives from a speech given by Holmes to his companion Doctor Watson on the nature of his work, in which he describes the story&apos;s murder investigation as his &quot;study in scarlet&quot;: &quot;There&#8217;s the scarlet thread of murder running through the colourless skein of life, and our duty is to unravel it, and isolate it, and expose every inch of it.&quot; \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

The locale is the little town of Shopton in upstateNew York, near Lake Carlopa. While some of Tom&#8217;s inventions are not well-founded in a scientific sense, others elaborated developments in the news and in popular magazines aimed at young science and invention enthusiasts. Presenting themselves as a forecast of future possibilities, they now and then hit close to the mark. Some predicted inventions that came true include &#8220;photo telephones&#8221;, vertical takeoff aircraft, aerial warships, giant cannons, and &#8220;wizard&#8221; cameras. However some other devices, such as magnetic silencers for motors, have not appeared yet.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

The story is set in the English city of Manchester during the 1830s and 1840s and deals heavily with the difficulties faced by the Victorian lower class.\n\nThe novel begins in Manchester, where we are introduced to the Bartons and the Wilsons, two working class families. John Barton reveals himself to be a great questioner of the distribution of wealth and the relation between the rich and the poor. He also relates how his sister-in-law Esther has disappeared after she ran away from home.\n\nSoon afterwards Mrs Barton dies, and John is left with his daughter Mary to cope in the harsh world around them. Having already been deeply affected by the loss of his son Tom at a young age, after the death of his wife, Barton tackles depression and begins to involve himself in the Chartist movement connected with the trade unions. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Trailin by Max Brand (Westerns)\n\n&#8220;Max Brand&#8221;, the most used pseudonym of Frederick Schiller Faust (1892-1944), is best known today for his western fiction. Faust began in the early twentieth century selling his stories to the pulp magazines, writing in many genres under numerous pseudonyms. He is probably best known as the creator of the character Destry. His novel Destry Rides Again has been filmed several times, most notably the 1939 version starring James Stewart and Marlene Dietrich. Also his character Dr. Kildare which was popularized in film and on television earned him a fortune. Faust&#8217;s novel The Untamed, the first of three novels featuring the classic western hero Dan Barry was filmed in 1920, starring Tom Mix. Faust became a front line war correspondent and died of wounds received while traveling with American soldiers in Italy, May 12, 1944.\n\nTrailin&#8217;! (1919) tells the story of Anthony Bard, a young aristocract from the east with a hunger for adventure, who sees his father murdered in the yard of their home. This starts young Anthony on a trail of vengeance that leads him to the far west. Here, Anthony, a tenderfoot with a knack for survival must track down a legendary outlaw who waits for him, not with a gun, but with a story. Along the way he braves the elements, resists a band of cold-blooded killers and finds love. A classic western revenge plot&#8230;..with a twist. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Daisy Miller: A Study in Two Parts by Henry James (Literature)\n\nDaisy Miller is an 1878 novella by Henry James. It portrays the confused courtship of the eponymous American girl by Winterbourne, a compatriot of hers with much more sophistication. His pursuit of her is hampered by her own flirtatiousness, which is frowned upon by the other expatriates they meet in Switzerland and Italy. Her lack of understanding of the social mores of the society she so desperately wishes to enter ultimately leads to tragedy.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

He criticizes &#8220;false teachers&#8221; who distort the authentic, apostolic tradition, and predicts judgement for them. He explains that God has delayed the Second Coming so that more people will have the chance to reject evil and find salvation.
