         "description" : "The Adventures of Pinocchio by Carlo Collodi (Fantasy) - Language: Italian\n\nThe Adventures of Pinocchio is a novel for children by Italian author Carlo Collodi (here transl. by Carol della Chiesa). The first half was published in serial form between 1881 and 1883, and then completed as a book for children in February 1883. It is about the mischievous adventures of Pinocchio, an animated marionette, and his poor father, a woodcarver named Geppetto. It is considered a classic of children&#8217;s literature and has spawned many derivative works of art, such as Disney&#8217;s classic 1940 animated movie of the same name, and commonplace ideas, such as a liar&#8217;s long nose.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Leviathan, or The Matter, Forme and Power of a Common Wealth Ecclesiasticall and Civil, Books I and II by Thomas Hobbes (Philopsophy, Politics)\n\nThe book concerns the structure of society (as represented figuratively by the frontispiece, showing the state giant made up of individuals).\n\nIn the book, Hobbes argues for a social contract and rule by a sovereign. Influenced by the English Civil War, Hobbes wrote that chaos or civil war &#8211; situations identified with a state of nature and the famous motto bellum omnium contra omnes (&#8221;the war of all against all&#8221;) &#8211; could only be averted by strong central government. He thus denied any right of rebellion toward the social contract. However, Hobbes did discuss the possible dissolution of the State. Since the social contract was made to institute a state that would provide for the &#8220;peace and defense&#8221; of the people, the contract would become void as soon as the government no longer protected its citizens. By virtue of this fact, man would automatically return to the state of nature until a new contract is made. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Winesburg, Ohio by Sherwood Anderson (Short Stories)\n\nPublished in 1919, and listed on the Modern Library roster of the 20th century&#8217;s 100 greatest novels in English, Winesburg, Ohio presents a series of loosely related character studies of the inhabitants of a fictional Midwestern town that together form a novel of unusual unity and vision. The inarticulate and lonely citizens of Winesburg, each with his or her own secret tale to tell, frequently relate those tales to, or through their interactions with, the character of George Willard, a young Winesburg citizen on the cusp of manhood with dreams of becoming a writer. Thus Winesburg tells the story of the townspeople&#8217;s loneliness and alienation in parallel with the tale of George&#8217;s own coming of age. The citizens of Winesburg are described obliquely as &#8220;grotesques,&#8221; but as the introductory chapter makes clear, &#8220;The grotesques were not all horrible. Some were amusing, some almost beautiful . . .&#8221; \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

It had the effect of a bomb. In the words of historian Barbara Tuchman, it was &#8220;one of the great commotions of history.&#8221; Zola&#8217;s intent was to force his own prosecution for libel so that the emerging facts of the Dreyfus case could be thoroughly aired. In this he succeeded. He was convicted, appealed, was retried, and, before hearing the result, fled to England on the advice of his counsel and friends, returning to Paris in June 1899 when he heard that Dreyfus&#8217;s trial was to be reviewed.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Principles of Economics, Book 1: Preliminary Survey by Alfred Marshall (Economics/Political Economy)\n\nPrinciples of Economics is a leading economics textbook by Alfred Marshall (1842-1924). Marshall began writing the treatise in 1881 and he spent much of the next decade at work on it. His plan for the work gradually extended to a two-volume compilation on the whole of economic thought; the first volume was published in 1890 to worldwide acclaim that established him as one of the leading economists of his time. It brought the ideas of supply and demand, of marginal utility and of the costs of production into a coherent whole, and became the dominant economic textbook in England for a long period. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Science and Hypothesis by Henri Poincar&#233; (Science)\n\nJules Henri Poincar&#233; (1854&#8211;1912) was one of France&#8217;s greatest mathematicians and theoretical physicists, and a philosopher of science.\n\nAs a mathematician and physicist, he made many original fundamental contributions to pure and applied mathematics, mathematical physics, and celestial mechanics. He was responsible for formulating the Poincar&#233; conjecture, one of the most famous problems in mathematics. In his research on the three-body problem, Poincar&#233; became the first person to discover a chaotic deterministic system which laid the foundations of modern chaos theory. He is considered to be one of the founders of the field of topology. Poincar&#233; introduced the modern principle of relativity and was the first to present the Lorentz transformations in their modern symmetrical form. He discovered the remaining relativistic velocity transformations and recorded them in a letter to Lorentz in 1905. Thus he obtained perfect invariance of all of Maxwell&#8217;s equations, the final step in the formulation of the theory of special relativity.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
