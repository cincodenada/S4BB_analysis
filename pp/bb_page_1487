         "description" : "The Story of Mary MacLane by Mary MacLane (Memoirs)\n\nAt the age of 19 in 1902, MacLane published her first book, The Story of Mary MacLane. It sold 100,000 copies in the first month and was popular among young girls, but was strongly criticized by conservative readers, and lightly ridiculed by H. L. Mencken. She had always chafed at living in Butte, which was a small mining town, and used the money from sales of this book to move to Greenwich Village where she continued to write books and newspaper articles.\n\nSome critics have suggested that even by today&#8217;s standards, MacLane&#8217;s writing is raw, honest, unflinching, self-aware, sensual and extreme. She wrote openly about egoism and her own self-love, about sexual attraction and love for other women, and even about her desire to marry the devil. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Moments of Vision and Miscellaneous Verses (Selection) by Thomas Hardy (Poetry)\n\nHardy claimed poetry as his first love, and published collections until his death in 1928. Although not as well received by his contemporaries as his novels, Hardy&#8217;s poetry has been applauded considerably in recent years. Most of his poems deal with themes of disappointment in love and life, and mankind&#8217;s long struggle against indifference to human suffering.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Tom Swift and the Visitor From Planet X by Victor Appleton (Children, Adventure, Teen/Young adult, Science fiction)\n\nTom Swift Jr. and his associates at Swift Enterprises wait breathlessly for what may well be the most important scientific event in history&#8212;the arrival of the visitor from Planet X&#8212;a visitor in the form of energy. But there are factions at work determined to snatch the energy, which Tom has named Exman, from the young scientist-inventor&#8217;s grasp. First, a series of unexplainable, devastating earthquakes threaten to destroy a good portion of the earth, and Tom suspects the Brungarian rebels who obviously would like to capture Exman and use the space visitor to further their own evil purposes. With the security of Enterprises and Exman at stake, Tom creates two of his greatest inventions&#8212;a Quakelizor to counteract the simulated earth tremors, and a container or &#8220;body&#8221; to house the energy from outer space. If the earthquakes cannot be stopped, the entire world will be threatened by destruction, and the Brungarian forces will conquer the earth. How Tom utilizes all his scientific knowledge to produce swift-action results and outwit the Brungarians makes one of the most exciting Tom Swift adventures to date.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Issued when Frost was approaching forty, it established his reputation and created a revolution in American poetry. With this publication, Frost became an established poet. He later became the major American poet of the twentieth century.\n\nA Boy&#8217;s Will is characteristic of Frost&#8217;s ability to conjure photographically clear physical images while ruminating on the complexities of the human condition, its frailties and strengths, and its temporal state, like that of his beloved New England landscape. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Thiselton Dyer (History, Myths/Legends)\n\n&#8220;Among other qualities which have been supposed to belong to a dead man&#8217;s hand, are its medicinal virtues, in connection with which may be mentioned the famous &#8216;dead hand,&#8217; which was, in years past, kept at Bryn Hall, Lancashire&#8230; Thus the case is related of a woman who, attacked with the smallpox, had this dead hand in bed with her every night for six weeks, and of a poor lad living near Manchester who was touched with it for the cure of scrofulous sores.&#8221;\n\nThough not all chapters have such gruesome subjects as The Dead Hand, all are full of a curious mixture of superstition and local history that will delight and amuse the modern listener.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion by David Hume (Philosophy, Religion)\n\nIn Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, philosopher David Hume examines whether belief in God can be rational. The work takes the form of a debate between three characters: Cleanthes, who argues that the existence and nature of God can be empirically verified; Demea, who argues that God is completely beyond human knowledge; and Philo, a philosophical skeptic widely thought to represent Hume&#8217;s own beliefs.\n\nMuch of the debate centers around Cleanthes&#8217; presentation of the analogical argument from design. According to this argument, the complexity and beauty of the universe can only be explained by inferring an intelligent designer, in the same way that one would infer a designer if one came across an intricately complicated machine. Philo presents several objections to this argument, with rejoinders by Cleanthes and occasional interjections by Demea.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

English, being a relatively new language, is a nice example of that. Though the English vocabulary is continually evolving, the system of punctuation has remained constant for the most part. This means that grammar books from 1895 are still applicable today. Therefore, if the following sentence looks correct to you, perhaps listening to Paul Allardyce&#8217;s &#8220;Stops, or How to Punctuate&#8221; would be a good idea.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Meditations by Marcus Aurelius (Philosophy)\n\nMarcus Aurelius wrote Meditations in Greek while on campaign between 170 and 180, as a source for his own guidance and self-improvement. These memos survive and continue to inspire others to this day. These writings take the form of quotations varying in length from one sentence to long paragraphs. He explicates the Stoic philosophy that the only way a man can be harmed by others is to allow his reaction to overpower him. He shows no particular religious faith in his writings, but seems to believe that some sort of logical, benevolent force organizes the universe in such a way that even &#8220;bad&#8221; occurrences happen for the good of the whole. \n\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Wage-Labour and Capital by Karl Marx (Economics/Political Economy, Politics)\n\nOrignally written as a series of newspaper articles in 1847, Wage-Labour and Capital was intended to give a short overview, for popular consumption, of Marx&#8217;s central threories regarding the economic relationships between workers and capitalists. These theories outlined include the Marxian form of the Labour Theory of Value, which distinguishes &#8220;labour&#8221; from &#8220;labour-power&#8221;, and the Theory of Concentration of Capital, which states that capitalism tends towards the creation of monopolies and the disenfranchisement of the middle and working classes. The Theory of Alienation, which describes a dehumanising effect of capitalist production, in which an immediate social signifcance of labour to the worker is absent, is also touched upon. These theories were later elaborated in Volume 1 of Capital, published in 1867.\n\nThis edition of Wage-Labour and Capital, published in 1891, was edited and translated by Friedrich Engels, and remains one of the most widely read of Marx&#8217;s works.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Don Quixote, Volume 2 by Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra (Adventure, Fiction, Literature)\n\nThis is volume 2 of 2.\n\nDon Quixote is an early novel written by Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra. Cervantes created a fictional origin for the story in the character of the Morisco historian, Cide Hamete Benengeli, whom he claims to have hired to translate the story from an Arabic manuscript he found in Toledo&#8217;s bedraggled old Jewish quarter.\n\nThe protagonist, Alonso Quixano, is a minor landowner who has read so many stories of chivalry that he descends into fantasy and becomes convinced he is a knight errant. Together with his companion Sancho Panza, the self-styled Don Quixote de la Mancha sets out in search of adventures. His &#8220;lady&#8221; is Dulcinea del Toboso, an imaginary object of his courtly love crafted from a neighbouring farmgirl by the illusion-struck &#8220;knight&#8221; (her real name is Aldonza Lorenzo, and she is totally unaware of his feelings for her. In addition, she never actually appears in the novel).\n\nPublished in two volumes a decade apart, Don Quixote is the most influential work of literature to emerge from the Spanish Golden Age and perhaps the entire Spanish literary canon. As a founding work of modern Western literature, it regularly appears at or near the top of lists of the greatest works of fiction ever published.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
