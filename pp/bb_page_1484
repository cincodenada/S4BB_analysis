         "description" : "Howards End by E. M. Forster (Romance)\n\nThe Schlegels frequently encounter the Wilcoxes. The youngest, Helen, is rejected by the younger Wilcox brother, Paul. The eldest, Margaret, becomes friends with his mother Ruth Wilcox. Ruth&#8217;s most prized personal possession is her family house at Howards End. She wishes that Margaret could live there, as she feels that it might be in good hands with her. Ruth&#8217;s own husband and children do not value the house and its rich history, because such abstractions, while being very dear to Margaret, are lost to them. As she is terminally ill, and Margaret and her family are about to be evicted from their London home by a developer, Ruth bequeaths the cottage to Margaret in a handwritten note found among her effects when she dies, causing great consternation among the Wilcoxes. Mrs Wilcox&#8217;s widowed husband Henry and his children burn the note without telling Margaret about her inheritance. However, over the course of several years, Margaret becomes friends with Henry Wilcox and eventually marries him. The more free-spirited Margaret tries to get Henry to open up more, to little effect. Henry&#8217;s elder son Charles and his wife try to keep Margaret from taking possession of Howards End.\n\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Beyond being a fascinating depiction of a now-alien time, occupation, and culture, it&#8217;s also a rousing adventure story. One is left with the impression that hunting and catching a whale in a sailing ship was akin to you or me being stalked, ambushed, and killed by a shoebox full of mice.\n\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Far from the Madding Crowd by Thomas Hardy (Literature)\n\nFar from the Madding Crowd (1874) is Thomas Hardy&#8217;s fourth novel and offers in ample measure the details of English rural life that Hardy so relished. Hardy&#8217;s growing taste for tragedy is also evident in the novel. It first appeared, anonymously, as a monthly magazine serial, where it gained a wide readership and critical acclaim. According to Virginia Woolf, &#8220;The subject was right; the method was right; the poet and the countryman, the sensual man, the sombre reflective man, the man of learning, all enlisted to produce a book which . . . must hold its place among the great English novels.&#8221; The book is often regarded as an early piece of feminist literature, since it features an independent woman with the courage to defy convention by running a farm herself. Although Bathsheba&#8217;s passionate nature leads her into serious errors of judgment, Hardy endows her with sufficient resilience, intelligence, and good luck to overcome her youthful folly. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "A Letter Concerning Toleration by John Locke\n\nLetter Concerning Toleration by John Locke was originally published in 1689. Its initial publication was in Latin, though it was immediately translated into other languages. In this &#8220;letter&#8221; addressed to an anonymous &#8220;Honored Sir&#8221; (actually Locke&#8217;s close friend Philip von Limborch, who published it without Locke&#8217;s knowledge) Locke argues for a new understanding of the relationship between religion and government. One of the founders of Empiricism, Locke develops a philosophy that is contrary to the one expressed by Thomas Hobbes in Leviathan, primarily because it supports toleration for various Christian denominations. Locke&#8217;s work appeared amidst a fear that Catholicism might be taking over England, and responds to the problem of religion and government by proposing toleration as the answer.\n\nUnlike Hobbes, who saw uniformity of religion as the key to a well-functioning civil society, Locke argues that more religious groups actually prevent civil unrest. Locke argues that civil unrest results from confrontations caused by any magistrate&#8217;s attempt to prevent different religions from being practiced, rather than tolerating their proliferation. Locke&#8217;s primary goal is to &#8220;distinguish exactly the business of civil government from that of religion.&#8221; He makes use of extensive argument from analogy to accomplish his goal, and relies on several key points. The thing that he wants to persuade the reader of is that government is instituted to promote external interests, relating to life, liberty, and the general welfare, while the church exists to promote internal interests, i.e., salvation. The two serve separate functions, and so, must be considered to be separate institutions.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
