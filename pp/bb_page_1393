         "description" : "The Way of All Flesh by Samuel Butler (Fiction, Literature, Satire)\n\nThe Way of All Flesh (1903) is a semi-autobiographical novel by Samuel Butler which attacks Victorian-era hypocrisy. Written between 1873 and 1884, it traces four generations of the Pontifex family. It represents the diminishment of religious outlook from a Calvinistic approach, which is presented as harsh. Butler dared not publish it during his lifetime, but when it was published it was accepted as part of the general revulsion against Victorianism.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Ruth by Elizabeth Cleghorn Gaskell (Fiction)\n\nThe book is a social novel, dealing with Victorian views about sin and illegitimacy. It is a surprisingly compassionate portrayal of a &#8216;fallen woman&#8217;, a type of person normally outcast from respectable society. The title of the novel refers to the main character Ruth Hilton, an orphaned young seamstress who is seduced and then abandoned by gentleman Henry Bellingham. Ruth, pregnant and alone, is taken in by a minister and his sister. They conceal her single status under the pretence of widowhood in order to protect her child from the social stigma of illegitimacy. Ruth goes on to gain a respectable position in society as a governess, which is threatened by the return of Bellingham and the revelation of her secret.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Poetry Miscellany 01 by Various (Poetry)\n\nAs we get older, many of us return to youthful memories of poems once significant to us. Outside their association with our youth, we may wonder what significance they have to us now. There were other poems we&#8217;ve met along the way as well: some held no appeal while others were forgotten. And there were others we never had the opportunity to meet.\n\nThis selection hopes to go beyond the experience of meeting old friends and on top opening the door to new ones &#8212;poems that might relate more significantly to our current lives. Originally titled &#8220;Personal Poems for Later Years,&#8221; this collection gestures towards poems that ask us to slow down some we can consider them more deeply than before &#8212;no matter our age.\n\nEach time we read a good poem it brings with it a different meaning. Meeting a poem with an open ear, be it old friend or new, we can find its deeper significance. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Time Traders by Andre Norton (Science Fiction)\n\nIf it is possible to conquer space, then perhaps it is also possible to conquer time. At least that was the theory American scientists were exploring in an effort to explain the new sources of knowledge the Russians possessed. Perhaps Russian scientists had discovered how to transport themselves back in time in order to learn long-forgotten secrets of the past.\n\nThat was why young Ross Murdock, above average in intelligence but a belligerently independent nonconformist, found himself on a &#8220;hush-hush&#8221; government project at a secret base in the Arctic. The very qualities that made him a menace in civilized society were valuable traits in a man who must successfully act the part of a merchant trader of the Beaker people during the Bronze Age.\n\nFor once they were transferred by time machine to the remote Baltic region where the Russian post was located, Ross and his partner Ashe were swept into a fantastic action-filled adventure involving Russians, superstitious prehistoric men, and the aliens of a lost galactic civilization that demanded every ounce of courage the Americans possessed.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Service&#8217;s third book of Yukon poems, published in 1909. The word Cheechako, from Chinook Jargon, originated in the United States (Alaska) and Canada (Yukon) and was imported into local English during the Yukon gold rush that began in 1896. Cheechako, is a non derogatory word meaning &#8220;newcomer&#8221; or &#8220;tenderfoot.&#8221; The derivation looks something like this: chee new cha come ko home. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Its importance was recognized in its later revival in paperback by Ballantine Books as the fifth volume of the celebrated Ballantine Adult Fantasy series in September, 1969. Lilith is considered among the darkest of MacDonald&#8217;s works, and among the most profound. It is a story concerning the nature of life, death and salvation. Many believe MacDonald is arguing for Christian universalism, or the idea that all will eventually be saved. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

He pioneered an entirely new route to the Pole and they returned. In Amundsen&#8217;s own words: &#8220;Victory awaits him who has everything in order &#8212; luck, people call it. Defeat is certain for him who has neglected to take the necessary precautions in time; this is called bad luck.&#8221; Short accounts by other members of the party are appended. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Expressman and the Detective by Allan Pinkerton (Mystery)\n\n    Allan Pinkerton (1819-1884), a Scotsman by birth and a barrel-maker by trade, settled in Chicago in its infancy and founded the Pinkertons, the world&apos;s first detective agency. Though events associated with the agency after his death have tarnished the name, Pinkerton himself was one of the original human rights advocates. He was a dear friend to John Brown, an advisor to Abraham Lincoln, and 80 years ahead of his time in hiring female detectives. He was also stubborn, irascible, and an egomaniac.\n\n    The Expressman and the Detective (1874) is Pinkerton&apos;s first attempt at putting his real-life experiences into novel form. Though many later works attributed to Pinkerton are understood to have been ghostwritten, this is the work of the man the London Times calls &quot;a man at once deeply admirable and quite obnoxious.&quot;\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Adventures of Reddy Fox by Thornton W. Burgess\n\t\t\nThe Adventures of Reddy Fox is another in the series of children&#8217;s stories by conservationist Thornton W. Burgess. In this story, Reddy and Granny Fox must outsmart Farmer Brown&#8217;s Boy who is out to get Reddy for stealing his pet chicken. Along the way, Reddy encounters many of the citizens of the Green Meadows and the Green Forest and with him we learn little lessons about life such as: the perils of being a show off; the importance of using all of one&#8217;s senses; that it is a fine thing to show sympathy and kindness to others &#8211; even our enemies; and that the value of a grandmother&#8217;s wisdom is inestimable.\n\nWe also learn that after you&#8217;ve stolen a boy&#8217;s pet chicken and he is coming your way with a gun, a shovel and a hound dog, it may be time to beat a hasty retreat.\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
