         "description" : "Scaramouche by Rafael Sabatini (History, Adventure, Historical Fiction, Romance)\n\nScaramouche is a romantic adventure and tells the story of a young aristocrat during the French Revolution. His successive endeavors as a lawyer, politician, actor, lover, and buffoon lead his enemies to call him &#8220;Scaramouche&#8221; (also called Scaramuccia, a roguish character in the commedia dell&#8217;arte), but he impresses many with his elegant orations and precision swordsmanship. The later film version includes one of the longest, and many believe, best swashbuckling sword-fighting scenes ever filmed.\n\nThe novel has a memorable start (Book I: The Robe, Chapter I, &#8216;The Republican&#8217;): &#8220;He was born with the gift of laughter and a sense that the world was mad. And that was all his patrimony. His very paternity was obscure, although the village of Gavrillacs had long since dispelled the cloud of mystery that hung about it.&#8221;\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Warlord of Kor by Terry Carr (Science Fiction)\n\nWarlord of Kor was originally published in 1963 as half of an Ace Double, selected by legendary editor Donald A. Wollheim. It is an interplanetary adventure, as humans probe the mysteries of the planet Hirlaj and the few remaining aliens who live there.\n\nTerry Carr never really shone as a writer, though he did write some remarkably thoughtful stories. However, his talents as an editor and anthologist were important and undeniable, and he brought many good writers and authors into science fiction and fantasy. His first couple of novels, of which Warlord of Kor was one, did not have their copyright renewed by Mr. Carr on purpose, one understands. So enjoy the blood and thunder, but don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s representative of his work!\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Three Men in a Boat (To Say Nothing of the Dog) by Jerome K. Jerome (Comedy, Animals, Nature)\n\nThree Men in a Boat (To Say Nothing of the Dog), published in 1889, is a humorous account by Jerome K. Jerome of a boating holiday on the Thames between Kingston and Oxford.\n\nThe book was intended initially to be a serious travel guide, with accounts of local history of places along the route, but the humorous elements eventually took over, to the point where the serious and somewhat sentimental passages now seem like an unnecessary distraction to the essentially comic novel. One of the most praised things about Three Men in a Boat is how undated it appears to modern readers. The jokes seem fresh and witty even today.\n\nThe three men were based on Jerome himself and two real-life friends, George, and Harris. The dog, Montmorency, however, was entirely fictional, but, as Jerome had remarked, &#8220;had much of me in it.&#8221;\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

The second is about Daniel Deronda, adopted son of an aristocratic Englishman who becomes fascinated with Jewish traditions when he meets an ailing Jewish philosopher named Mordecai and his sensitive sister, Mirah.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Anthem by Ayn Rand (Science fiction, Philosophy)\n\nAnthem is a dystopic science fiction story taking place at some unspecified future date. Mankind has entered another dark age as a result of what Rand saw as the weaknesses of socialistic thinking and economics. Technological advancement is now carefully planned (when it is allowed to occur, if at all) and the concept of individuality has been eliminated (for example, the word &#8220;I&#8221; has disappeared from the language). As is common in her work, Rand draws a clear distinction between the &#8220;socialist/communal&#8221; values of equality and brotherhood and the &#8220;productive/capitalist&#8221; values of achievement and individuality. The story also parallels Stalinist Russia, which was currently going on at the time as the story was published.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Morshead.\n\nThe Oresteia is a trilogy by Aeschylus, one of the foremost playwrights of ancient Greece. It encompasses three plays: Agamemnon, The Libation Bearers, and The Furies. It tells the tragic tale of the House of Atreus, whose inhabitants have been cursed and are doomed to play out their bloody, vengeful destinies. At the beginning of the first part, the Trojan War has ended and the Greek general, Agamemnon, is returning victorious to his wife Clytemnestra. Yet she finds it difficult to forgive his sacrifice of their daughter, Iphigenia, who was killed to ensure the Greek fleet fair winds in their voyage to Troy. Her desire for vengeance, and its dire consequences, instigates the action of these poetic tragedies. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Woman in White by Wilkie Collins (Epistolary fiction, Mystery)\n\nThe Woman in White is an epistolary novel written by Wilkie Collins in 1859, serialized in 1859-1860, and first published in book form in 1860. It is considered to be to the first mystery novel, and is widely regarded as one of the first (and finest) in the genre of &#8217;sensation novels&#8217;&#8230;.\n\nThe Woman in White is also an early example of a particular type of Collins narrative in which several characters in turn take up the telling of the story. This creates a complex web in which readers are unsure which narrator can, and cannot, be trusted. Collins used this technique in his other novels, including The Moonstone. This technique was copied by other novelists, including Bram Stoker, author of Dracula (1897), although by the end of the 19th century the technique was considered &#8220;old-fashioned&#8221;.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
