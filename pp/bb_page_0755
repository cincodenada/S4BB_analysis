Special emphasis is given to the principles of biological adaptation and evolution, especially how they relate to the rise of the human species from lower orders. Also included are the basics of the (then) fairly new concept of relativity and its impact on emerging scientific theories.\n\nSince first posted at Project Gutenberg in 2006, the text of\nThe Outline of Science, Volume 1 has consistently ranked in\nthe &#8220;Top 100 EBooks&#8221; category.\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Famous Sea Fights by by John R. Hale\n\t\t\nI propose to tell in non-technical and popular language the story of some of the most remarkable episodes in the history of sea power. I shall begin with the first sea-fight of which we have a detailed history&#8212;the Battle of Salamis (B.C. 480), the victory by which Themistocles the Athenian proved the soundness of his maxim that &#8220;he who commands the sea commands all.&#8221; I shall end with the last and greatest of naval engagements, the Battle of Tsu-shima, an event that reversed the long experience of victory won by West over East, which began with Salamis more than two thousand years ago.\nI shall have to tell of British triumphs on the sea from Sluys to Trafalgar; but I shall take instances from the history of other countries also, for it is well that we should remember that the skill, enterprise, and courage of admirals and seamen is no exclusive possession of our own people.\nI shall incidentally describe the gradual evolution of the warship from the wooden, oar-driven galleys that fought in the Straits of Salamis to the steel-built, steam-propelled giants that met in battle in the Straits of Tsu-shima. I shall have something to say of old seafaring ways, and much to tell of the brave deeds done by men of many nations. These true stories of the sea will, I trust, have not only the interest that belongs to all records of courage, danger, and adventure, but also some practical lessons of their own.\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

The man is riding on the ass.&#8221;\n\n&#8220;The real mistake of the Muslims is something much more modern in its application than any particular passing persecution of Christians as such. It lay in the very fact that they did think they had a simpler and saner sort of Christianity, as do many modern Christians. They thought it could be made universal merely by being made uninteresting. Now a man preaching what he thinks is a platitude is far more intolerant than a man preaching what he admits is a paradox. It was exactly because it seemed self-evident, to Muslims as to Bolshevists, that their simple creed was suited to everybody, that they wished in that particular sweeping fashion to impose it on everybody.\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

This collection, &#8220;Poems: Series One&#8221;, presents the first installment of the complete poetic works of Miss Emily Dickinson. It is broken into four parts: Life, Love, Nature, and Time and Eternity.\n\nThe verses of Emily Dickinson belong emphatically to what Emerson long since called &#8220;the Poetry of the Portfolio,&#8221;&#8211;something produced absolutely without the thought of publication, and solely by way of expression of the writer&#8217;s own mind. The poetry found here is then entirely honest, and indicative of the authors true feelings.\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

(J. Stevenson, A new Eusebius [London: SPCK, 1965] p. 120) This is one quote from the epistle: &#8220;Stand fast, therefore, in this conduct and follow the example of the Lord, &#8216;firm and unchangeable in faith, lovers of the brotherhood, loving each other, united in truth,&#8217; helping each other with the mildness of the Lord, despising no man.&#8221;\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Ruth from the American Standard Version\n\t\t\nDuring the time of the Judges when there was a famine, an Israelite family from Bethlehem &#8211; Elimelech, his wife Naomi, and their sons Mahlon and Chilion &#8211; emigrate to the nearby country of Moab. Elimelech dies, and the sons marry two Moabite women: Mahlon marries Ruth and Chilion marries Orpah. Then Mahlon and Chilion also die. Naomi decides to return to Bethlehem. She tells her daughters-in-law to return to their own mothers, and remarry. Orpah reluctantly leaves; however, Ruth says, &#8220;Don&#8217;t urge me to leave you or to turn back from you. Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God. Where you die I will die, and there I will be buried. May the LORD deal with me, be it ever so severely, if anything but death separates you and me.&#8221; (Ruth 1:16-17 NIV) The two women return to Bethlehem. It is the time of the barley harvest, and in order to support her mother-in-law and herself, Ruth goes to the fields to glean. The field she goes to belongs to a man named Boaz, who is kind to her because he has heard of her loyalty to her mother-in-law. Ruth tells her mother-in-law of Boaz&#8217;s kindness, and she gleans in his field through the remainder of the harvest season. Boaz is a close relative of Naomi&#8217;s husband&#8217;s family. He is therefore obliged by the levirate law to marry Mahlon&#8217;s widow, Ruth, in order to carry on his family line. Naomi sends Ruth to the threshing floor at night and tells her to &#8220;uncover the feet&#8221; of the sleeping Boaz. Ruth does so, Boaz awakes, and Ruth reminds him that he is &#8220;the one with the right to redeem.&#8221; Boaz is willing to &#8220;redeem&#8221; Ruth, but there is a closer relative with a stronger right to do so. The next morning, Boaz discusses the issue with this man before the town elders. The other relative is unwilling to jeopardise the inheritance of his own estate by marrying Ruth, and so Boaz is free to do so. Boaz and Ruth get married and have a son named Obed (who by levirate customs is also considered a son or heir to Mahlon, and thus Naomi&#8217;s grandson). In the genealogy which concludes the story, it is pointed out that Obed is the descendant of Perez the son of Judah, and the grandfather of David.\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
