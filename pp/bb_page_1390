         "description" : "Introduction to The Philosophy of History by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. Translated by John Sibree. (Philosophy, History)\n\nThe introduction to Hegel&#8217;s lectures on the philosophy of world history is often used to introduce students to Hegel&#8217;s philosophy, in part because Hegel&#8217;s sometimes difficult style is muted in the lectures, and he discourses on accessible themes such as world events in order to explain his philosophy. Much of the work is spent defining and characterizing Geist or spirit. Geist is similar to the culture of people, and is constantly reworking itself to keep up with the changes of society, while at the same time working to produce those changes through what Hegel called the &#8220;cunning of reason&#8221;. Another important theme of the text is the focus on world history, rather than regional or state history.\n\nThe obscure writings of Jakob B&#246;hme had a strong effect on Hegel. B&#246;hme had written that the Fall of Man was a necessary stage in the evolution of the universe. This evolution was, itself, the result of God&#8217;s desire for complete self-awareness. Hegel was fascinated by the works of Spinoza, Kant, Rousseau, and Goethe, and by the French Revolution. Modern philosophy, culture, and society seemed to Hegel fraught with contradictions and tensions, such as those between the subject and object of knowledge, mind and nature, self and Other, freedom and authority, knowledge and faith, the Enlightenment and Romanticism. Hegel&#8217;s main philosophical project was to take these contradictions and tensions and interpret them as part of a comprehensive, evolving, rational unity that, in different contexts, he called &#8220;the absolute idea&#8221; or &#8220;absolute knowledge&#8221;.\n\nAccording to Hegel, the main characteristic of this unity was that it evolved through and manifested itself in contradiction and negation. Contradiction and negation have a dynamic quality that at every point in each domain of reality&#8212;consciousness, history, philosophy, art, nature, society&#8212;leads to further development until a rational unity is reached that preserves the contradictions as phases and sub-parts through an up-lifting (Aufhebung) into a higher unity. This whole is mental because it is mind that can comprehend all of these phases and sub-parts as steps in its own process of comprehension. It is rational because the same, underlying, logical, developmental order underlies every domain of reality and is ultimately the order of self-conscious rational thought, although only in the later stages of development does it come to full self-consciousness. The rational, self-conscious whole is not a thing or being that lies outside of other existing things or minds. Rather, it comes to completion only in the philosophical comprehension of individual existing human minds who, through their own understanding, bring this developmental process to an understanding of itself.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Longest Journey by E. M. Forster (Literature)\n \nFrederick Elliot is a student at early 20th century Cambridge, a university that seems like paradise to him, amongst bright if cynical companions, when he receives a visit from two friends, an engaged young woman, Agnes Pembroke, and her older brother, Herbert. The Pembrokes are Rickie&#8217;s only friends from home. An orphan who grew up living with cousins, he was sent to a public (boarding) school where he was shunned and bullied because of his lame foot, an inherited weakness, and frail body. Agnes, as it happens, is engaged to Gerald, now in the army, who was one of the sturdy youths who bullied Rickie at school. Rickie is not brilliant at argument, but he is intensely responsive to poetry and art, and is accepted within a circle of philosophical and intellectual fellow-students led by a brilliant but especially cynical aspiring philosopher, Stuart Ansell, who refuses, when he is introduced to her, even to acknowledge that Agnes exists.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Aeneid by Vergilius Maro, Publius, 70 B.C. to 19 A.D., translated by John Dryden, 1631 to 1700 (Literature, Poetry, Adventure)\n\nThe Aeneid is a Latin epic written by Virgil in the 1st century BC that tells the legendary story of Aeneas, a Trojan who traveled to Italy, where he became the ancestor of the Romans. The first six of the poem&#8217;s twelve books tell the story of Aeneas&#8217; wanderings from Troy to Italy, and the poem&#8217;s second half treats the Trojans&#8217; ultimately victorious war upon the Latins, under whose name Aeneas and his Trojan followers are destined to be subsumed. The poem was commissioned from Vergil by the Emperor Augustus to glorify Rome. Several critics think that the hero Aeneas&#8217; abandonment of the Cartheginian Queen Dido, is meant as a statement of how Augustus&#8217; enemy, Mark Anthony, should have behaved with the Egyptian Queen Cleopatra. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Master of the World by Jules Verne (Science fiction, Adventure, Mystery)\n\nChief Inspector Strock gets the tough cases. When a volcano suddenly appears to threaten mountain towns of North Carolina amid the non-volcanic Blue Ridge Mountains, Strock is posted to determine the danger. When an automobile race in Wisconsin is interrupted by the unexpected appearance of a vehicle traveling at multiples of the top speed of the entrants, Strock is consulted. When an odd-shaped boat is sighted moving at impossible speeds off the New England coast, Stock and his boss begin to wonder if the incidents are related. And when Strock gets a hand-lettered note warning him to abandon his investigation, on pain of death, he is intrigued rather than deterred.\n\nSet in a period when gasoline engines were in their infancy and automobiles were rare, and when even Chief Inspectors had to engage a carriage and horses to move about, the appearance of a vehicle that can move at astounding speeds on land, on water &#8211; and as later revealed, underwater and through the air &#8211; marks a technological advance far beyond the reach of nations. It is technology invented by and for the sole benefit of a man who styles himself (with some justification) &#8220;The Master of the World.&#8221;\n\nThis book is a sequel to an earlier Verne novel, &#8220;Robur the Conqueror&#8221;, but enough detail is given to fully appreciate this story without having first read the other.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

The Elliots were dissatisfied with Anne&#8217;s choice, feeling he was not distinguished enough for their family, and her older friend and mentor, Lady Russell, acting in place of Anne&#8217;s deceased mother, persuaded her to break off the match. Now 27 and considered a spinster, Anne re-encounters her former fiance, now a captain, as he courts her spirited young neighbour, Louisa Musgrove. The self-interested machinations of Anne&#8217;s older sister Elizabeth, of Elizabeth&#8217;s friend Mrs. Clay, and of Anne&#8217;s father&#8217;s heir, William Elliot, constitute an important subplot.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Shirley Letters from California Mines in 1851-52 by Louise Amelia Knapp Smith Clappe (Memoirs, History)\n\nLouise Amelia Knapp Smith Clappe moved to California from Massachusetts during the Gold Rush of the mid-1800&#8217;s. During her travels, Louise was offered the opportunity to write for The Herald about her travel adventures. It was at this point that Louise chose the name &#8220;Shirley&#8221; as her pen name. Dame Shirley wrote a series of 23 letters to her sister Mary Jane (also known as Molly) in Massachusetts in 1851 and 1852. The &#8220;Shirley Letters&#8221;, as the collected whole later became known, gave true accounts of life in two gold mining camps on the Feather River in the 1850s. She described these camps in Northern California with vividness in portraying the wildness of Gold Rush life. The letters give detailed accounts of the vast and beautiful landscape that was the background to the hustle and bustle of mining life. Louise&#8217;s perspective as a woman provided a contrast to the typically all-male mining camps that she occupied. The letters were later published in the Pioneer, a California literary magazine based out of San Francisco.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Sister Carrie by Theodore Dreiser (Fiction, Literature)\n\nTheodore Dreiser was an American author of the naturalist school, known for dealing with the gritty reality of life. Sister Carrie (1900) is his first novel and tells the story of a young country girl who moves to the big city (Chicago) where she starts realizing her own American Dream by first becoming a mistress to powerful men and later as a famous actress.\n\nDreiser and his wife significantly altered the original manuscript to make it more palatable to the prevailing sensibilities of the day, but even this toned down version caused a minor scandal, and Dreiser had difficulty finding a publisher for it. This was due to the blurred division line between good and bad in the plot. Although Dreiser&#8217;s moralizing narrator does assert that, despite the fame and the money she has amassed, Carrie will not be able to achieve peace of mind in her life, the apparent lack of poetic justice &#8212; the notion that immorality should pay in the end, even if only up to a point &#8212; was a concept the reading public were altogether unused to at the time.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Philippics by Marcus Tullius Cicero (Politics, Essay/Short nonfiction, Classics (antiquity), Ancient Texts, History)\n\nA philippic is a fiery, damning speech delivered to condemn a particular political actor. The term originates with Demosthenes, who delivered an attack on Philip II of Macedon in the 4th century BCE.\n\nCicero consciously modeled his own attacks on Mark Antony, in 44 BC and 43 BC, on Demosthenes&#8217;s speeches, and if the correspondence between M. Brutus and Cicero are genuine (ad Brut. ii 3.4, ii 4.2), at least the fifth and seventh speeches were referred to as the Philippics in Cicero&#8217;s time. They were also called the Antonian Orations by Aulus Gellius. It is ironic that they were named after a series of speeches that failed to effectively warn the Greeks of the danger of Philip of Macedon whose son, Alexander the Great, went on to be one of the greatest conquerors of all time. After the death of Caesar, Cicero privately expressed regrets that the murderers of Caesar had not included Antony in their plot and became focused on discrediting Antony. Cicero even promoted illegal action, such as legitimatizing Octavian&#8217;s private army. In total, Cicero made 14 Phillipics in less than two years &#8211; an impressively energetic feat for the over 60 ex-consul. Cicero&#8217;s focus on Antony, however, would contribute to his downfall as he failed to recognize the threat of Octavian and ignored and promoted illegal actions. Cicero&#8217;s attacks on Antony did not go unpunished and in 43 BC he was proscribed and killed. His head and hands were publicly displayed in the forum discouraging those who would openly oppose the new Triumvirate of Octavian, Mark Antony and Lepidus.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Elegiac Sonnets and Other Poems by Charlotte Turner Smith (Poetry)\n\nCharlotte Turner Smith (1749 &#8211; 1806) was an English poet and novelist. She initiated a revival of the English sonnet, helped establish the conventions of Gothic fiction, and wrote political novels of sensibility.\n\nIt was in 1784, in debtor&#8217;s prison with her husband Benjamin, that she wrote and published her first work, Elegiac Sonnets. The work achieved instant success, allowing Charlotte to pay for their release from prison. Smith&#8217;s sonnets helped initiate a revival of the form and granted an aura of respectability to her later novels.\n\nStuart Curran, the editor of Smith&#8217;s poems, has written that Smith is &#8220;the first poet in England whom in retrospect we would call Romantic&#8221;. She helped shape the &#8220;patterns of thought and conventions of style&#8221; for the period. Romantic poet William Wordsworth was the most affected by her works. He said of Smith in the 1830s that she was &#8220;a lady to whom English verse is under greater obligations than are likely to be either acknowledged or remembered&#8221;. By the second half of the nineteenth century, however, Smith was largely forgotten. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

The novel is a whodunit whose unique place in the history of detective fiction is because it is at the same time the first major send-up of that very genre: Not only does Trent fall in love with one of the primary suspects &#8212; usually considered a no-no &#8212; he also, after painstakingly collecting all the evidence, draws all the wrong conclusions. Convinced that he has tracked down the murderer of a business tycoon who was shot in his mansion, he is told by the real perpetrator over dinner what mistakes in the logical deduction of the solution of the crime he has made. On hearing what really happened, Trent vows that he will never again attempt to dabble in crime detection.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
