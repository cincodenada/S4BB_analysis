Nevertheless it &#8220;never was intended for the stage&#8221; and is here declaimed by a single reader.\n\nSamson the blinded captive, in company with the Chorus of friends and countrymen, receives his visitors on their varying missions and through them his violent story is vividly recalled. Then he is summoned to give a final demonstration of God-given strength to entertain the Philistines, his captors. Famously &#8211; and of course, offstage &#8211; his performance brings the house down. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Candide by Voltaire (Fantasy)\n\nCandide, ou l&#8217;Optimisme, (&#8221;Candide, or Optimism&#8221;) (1759) is a picaresque novel by the Enlightenment philosopher Voltaire. Voltaire never openly admitted to having written the controversial Candide; the work is signed with a pseudonym: &#8220;Monsieur le docteur Ralph&#8221;, literally &#8220;Mister Doctor Ralph.&#8221;Sardonic in outlook, it follows the na&#239;ve protagonist Candide from his first exposure to the precept that &#8220;all is for the best in this, the best of all possible worlds,&#8221; and on through a series of adventures that dramatically disprove that precept even as the protagonist clings to it.The novel satirizes na&#239;ve interpretations of the philosophy of Gottfried Leibniz and is a showcase of the horrors of the 18th century world. In Candide, Leibniz is represented by the philosopher Pangloss, the tutor of the title character. Despite a series of misfortunes and misadventures, which include being present at the Lisbon Earthquake, Pangloss continually asserts that &#8220;Tout est pour le mieux dans le meilleur des mondes possibles&#8221; (&#8221;All is for the best in the best of all possible worlds&#8221;). The novel ends with Candide finally rejecting the optimism espoused by Pangloss, saying, &#8220;Il faut cultiver notre jardin&#8221; (&#8221;It is necessary to cultivate our garden&#8221;).\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Drums of Jeopardy by Harold MacGrath (Fiction, Horror/Ghost Stories)\n\nThe Drums of Jeopardy is a 1920 American novel by Harold MacGrath. The story was serialized by the The Saturday Evening Post beginning in January of 1920.\nIn 1922 the book was made into a Broadway play and the following year a motion picture. A second film version appeared in 1931.\nIt is said that a young Boris Karloff, who previously had a few uncredited film roles, chose his stage name for his first screen credit in 1920 from a Russian mad scientist character named &#8220;Boris Karlov&#8221; in this novel. The name &#8220;Boris Karlov&#8221; was used from MacGrath&#8217;s book for the 1922 Broadway play, but by 1923 with actor Boris Karloff using the similar sounding variation, the film version renamed the character, played by Wallace Beery, &#8220;Gregor Karlov.&#8221; In the 1931 film version, however, with Warner Oland playing the character, the mad scientist&#8217;s name is restored to &#8220;Boris Karlov,&#8221; less than a year before Frankenstein would make Boris Karloff a household word for generations. Ironically, Boris Karloff would play many mad scientists on screen, but never &#8220;Boris Karlov.&#8221;\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Federalist Papers by Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, and James Madison.\n\nThe Federalist Papers (correctly known as The Federalist) are a series of 85 articles advocating the ratification of the United States Constitution. Seventy-seven of the essays were published serially in The Independent Journal and The New York Packet between October 1787 and August 1788 . A compilation of these and eight others, called The Federalist, was published in 1788 by J. and A. M&#8217;Lean.\nThe Federalist Papers serve as a primary source for interpretation of the Constitution, as they outline the philosophy and motivation of the proposed system of government.The authors of the Federalist Papers wanted to both influence the vote in favor of ratification and shape future interpretations of the Constitution. According to historian Richard Morris, they are an &#8220;incomparable exposition of the Constitution, a classic in political science unsurpassed in both breadth and depth by the product of any later American writer.&#8221;\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Studies in Pessimism by Arthur Schopenhauer (Philosophy)\n\n\nArthur Schopenhauer, an early 19th century philosopher, made significant contributions to metaphysics, ethics, and aesthetics. His work also informed theories of evolution and psychology, largely through his theory of the will to power &#8211; a concept which Nietzsche famously adopted and developed. Despite this, he is today, as he was during his life, overshadowed by his contemporary, Hegel. Schopenhauer&#8217;s social/psychological views, put forth in this work and in others, are directly derived from his metaphysics, which was strongly influenced by Eastern thought. His pessimism forms an interesting and perhaps questionable contrast with his obvious joy in self-expression, both in the elegance of his prose and in his practice of playing the flute nightly.\n\nHis brilliance, poetry, and crushing pessimism can be seen immediately in this work, as for example in this claim from the first chapter: &#8220;The pleasure in this world, it has been said, outweighs the pain; or, at any rate, there is an even balance between the two. If the reader wishes to see shortly whether this statement is true, let him compare the respective feelings of two animals, one of which is engaged in eating the other.&#8221; We see also, in this work, his misogyny, as for example in his claim that &#8220;as lions are provided with claws and teeth, and elephants and boars with tusks, . . . so Nature has equipped woman, for her defence and protection, with the arts of dissimulation; and all the power which Nature has conferred upon man in the shape of physical strength and reason, has been bestowed upon women in this form.&#8221; Given his opening comment, the translator, T.B. Saunders, seems to have been at least somewhat sympathetic to this perspective.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Social Contract by Jean-Jacques Rousseau ( Philosophy, Politics )\n\nThe Social Contract outlines Rousseau&#8217;s views on political justice, explaining how a just and legitimate state is to be founded, organized and administered. Rousseau sets forth, in his characteristically brazen and iconoclastic manner, the case for direct democracy, while simultaneously casting every other form of government as illegitimate and tantamount to slavery. Often hailed as a revolutionary document which sparked the French Revolution, The Social Contract serves both to inculcate dissatisfaction with actually-existing governments and to allow its readers to envision and desire a radically different form of political and social organization.

         "description" : "The General Epistle of James by American Standard Version\n\nThe Epistle of James is a book in the Christian New Testament. The author identifies himself as James (James 1:1), traditionally understood as James the Just, the brother of Jesus, first of the Seventy Disciples and first Bishop of Jerusalem. \nWith no overriding theme, the text condemns various sins and calls on Christians to be patient while awaiting the imminent Second Coming. \nThe epistle has caused controversy: Protestant reformer Martin Luther argued that it was not the work of an apostle. Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy and Mormonism claim it contradicts Luther&#8217;s doctrine of justification through faith alone (Sola fide) derived from his translation of Romans 3:28. The Christian debate over Justification is still unsettled, see also Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification and Christian view of the Law.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

This epistle contains some of the best-known phrases in the New Testament, including (depending on the translation) &#8220;without love, I am nothing&#8221; (13:1) and &#8220;when I was a child, I spoke as a child, I felt as a child, I thought as a child&#8221; (13:11). Paul turns the hearts of Christians from selfish factionalism to selfless service of others in love.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Exercises in Knitting by Cornelia Mee (Instruction)\n\nMrs. Mee, her husband, and her sister ran a yarn and needlework import/warehouse business in Bath, England. Her books primarily contain practical everyday items that knit up quickly with the busy homemaker in mind. At this time, published knitting &#8220;receipts&#8221; did not contain abbreviations and were laborious to use. They were, however, rich in error!\n\nLater in her career, due to circumstances of war and the resulting social stress and poverty, many of her knitting books were printed for ladies&#8217; charitable societies, which used her knitting &#8220;receipts&#8221; to clothe the poor mill workers who were out of work due to the American Civil War and the embargo of cotton.\n\nIn addition to recording the original patterns, LibriVox knitters have also knitted samples of these patterns, displayed at the KnitWiki, and have attempted to condense and clarify the patterns for the enjoyment of modern day knitters.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
