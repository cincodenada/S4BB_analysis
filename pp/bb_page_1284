         "description" : "Gone To Earth by Mary Webb\n\t\t\n&#8220;Gone to Earth&#8221; is the cry of fox hunters as the fox takes to its den and they lose the chase. Here, Mary Webb tells the story of Hazel Woodus whose understanding of her half tame fox cub contrasts with her misunderstanding of humanity. She is pursued by two very different men, a Gentleman Farmer and the local Minister. Mary Webb&#8217;s writing is sometimes compared to that of Thomas Hardy, her descriptions of nature are vivid and her view of love and life is touched with tragedy. She wrote this book in 1917 and it is set in the borderlands of rural Shropshire.\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Yet, even as a great city burns and darkness threatens to overwhelm the age, hope is found in the love of the Roman tribune Marcus Vinicius for the beautiful Christian maiden Lygia, and in his journey toward his life&#8217;s true purpose.\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Black Beauty by Anna Sewell\n\t\t\nBlack Beauty is a fictional autobiographical memoir told by a horse, who recounts many tales, both of cruelty and kindness. The title page of the first edition states that it was &#8220;Translated from the Original Equine by Anna Sewell.&#8221; It was composed in the last years of her life, during which she was confined to her house as an invalid. After its publication in 1877, Sewell lived just long enough to see her first and only novel become an immediate bestseller, as well as it encouraging the better treatment of many cruelly-treated animals.\n\nAlthough initially intended for people who work with horses, it soon became a children&#8217;s classic. While outwardly teaching animal welfare, it also contains allegorical lessons about how to treat people with kindness, sympathy and respect. The story is narrated in the first person and each short chapter relates an incident in Black Beauty&#8217;s life, with Sewell&#8217;s detailed observations and extensive descriptions of horse behaviour lending the novel a good deal of verisimilitude.\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Crome Yellow by Aldous Huxley (1894-1963) (Satire)\n\nCrome Yellow, published in 1921 was Aldous Huxley&#8217;s first novel. In it he satirizes the fads and fashions of the time. It is the witty story of a house party at &#8216;Crome&#8217; where there is a gathering of bright young things. We hear some of the history of the house from Henry Wimbush, its owner and self appointed historian; Apocylapse is prophesied, virginity is lost, and inspirational aphorisms are gained in a trance. Our hero, Denis, tries to capture it all in poetry and is disappointed in love.\n\nThe author, Aldous Huxley, was born in 1894 and began writing poetry and short stories in his early twenties; this was his first novel and established his literary reputation. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

(Fairy tales, Children, Short stories)\n\nWith no written language, Native Americans living in the Lake Superior region passed their cultural identity down through the generations by way of stories. Far more than mere tales to amuse children, they passed along the collective wisdom of the tribes. In the 1830s, government Indian Agent and ethnologist Henry R Schoolcraft learned the language of these people and went out to collect and preserve their stories before the tribes disappeared under the westward rush of American civilization. Though these stories were recast as children&#8217;s fairy tales in the 1920s, they contain much of the old wisdom of a culture which has largely disappeared. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Thanks to Capt. Crewe&#8217;s money, Sara is treated as a little princess until, one day, word comes of her father&#8217;s tragic death. Miss Minchin, the school&#8217;s greedy headmistress, wastes no time in putting the now-penniless Sara to work for her room and board. It is only through the friendship of two other girls, her own resolute nature, and some astonishing luck that Sara eventually finds her way back to happiness. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Reginald by Saki (1870-1916) (Comedy, Short stories) \n\nSaki was the pen name of the British author Hector Hugh Munro (1870 &#8211; 1916). His witty, biting and occasionally odd short stories satirised Edwardian culture. Saki is considered a master of the short story and has been compared to O. Henry and Dorothy Parker as well as Noel Coward and Oscar Wilde (who clearly influenced Saki).\n\nHis first collection of short stories, Reginald, was published by Methuen Press in 1904 though these stories first appeared in the &#8216;Westminster Gazette&#8217;. The stories in this collection are a foil for allowing the jaded and insider/outsider figure of Reginald to comment on some ridiculous or provincial attitudes prevalent in upper class Edwardian society, although one can easily recognize these same attitudes in our society today. Long popular and well known, Saki&#8217;s brilliant humour is as enjoyable now as it was almost a century ago.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Our Mutual Friend by Charles Dickens (1812-1870) (Fiction)\n\nDickens&#8217; last complete novel was published serially 1864-5. It begins with an intriguing fortune offered to John Harmon by his late father, a rich dust contractor, in his will.\n\nTo receive the money, John must marry a certain Bella Wilfer who he does not know from Eve. He is returning from the exile enforced by his father and confides in a ship&#8217;s mate who attempts to murder him. The mate gets killed instead, leaving one inconvenient corpse. Because John is considered dead (the body is found with his papers), the money passes to Mr Boffin, old Harmon&#8217;s foreman. Harmon adopts Bella and John comes into his employ disguised as John Rokesmith. Bella does not fall for John but through kindly Boffin&#8217;s contrivances learns to hate money and fall for her suitor under his false name. Eventually she learns of his true identity as the Boffins had previously, and the villainous one-legged Silas Wegg&#8217;s plot to blackmail Mr Boffin is brought to light.\n\nThere is also a story running behind the main plot about a certain Eugene Wrayburn and his love for Lizzie Hexam, and his rival&#8217;s attempt to murder him. The two plots are only really connected through the waterside murders but it allows Dickens to indulge in an extremely socially diverse cast of characters.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
