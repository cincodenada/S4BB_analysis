         "description" : "The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus by L. Frank Baum (Fantasy, Children)\n\nThis story of Santa Claus veers away slightly from the traditional stories of his beginnings. L. Frank Baum creates a world of fantasy that surrounds Santa Claus&#8217;s life. Orphaned at an infant he is found by the nymph Necile, who convinces the great Ak to allow her to raise Claus for her own. As he grows older he meets his fellow humans, and sees the neglect of children. This sets him on the path to making toys and becoming the beloved Saint Nicholas we are familiar with today. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Barchester Towers by Anthony Trollope (Literature)\n\nThis is the second in Trollope&#8217;s &#8216;Barsetshire&#8217; series of novels. The later novels in the series move away from Barchester itself but &#8216;Barchester Towers&#8217; is very much a sequel to the first book &#8216;The Warden&#8217;, which is also available from Librivox.\n\nThe old bishop dies, the archdeacon, Dr. Grantly fails to succeed him and a new bishop, Dr. Proudie is appointed. Dr. Grantly gains a worthy foe, not the new bishop but his wife, Mrs. Proudie, strict sabatarian and power behind the Episcopal throne together with the bishop&#8217;s chaplain, Mr. Slope.\n\nJohn Bold is also dead and Eleanor, now a wealthy young widow sets clerical hearts fluttering. The new bishop must deal with the wardenship of Hiram&#8217;s Hospital. Will it go to Mr. Harding? All is to play for. Then the old Dean dies and the stakes are raised. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Lady Susan by Jane Austen (Literature, Fiction)\n\nJane Austen demonstrated her mastery of the epistolary novel genre in Lady Susan, which she wrote in 1795 but never published. Although the primary focus of this short novel is the selfish behavior of Lady Susan as she engages in affairs and searches for suitable husbands for herself and her young daughter, the actual action shares its importance with Austen&#8217;s manipulation of her characters&#8217; behavior by means of their reactions to the letters that they receive. The heroine adds additional interest by altering the tone of her own letters based on the recipient of the letter. Thus, the character of Lady Susan is developed through many branches as Austen suggests complications of identity and the way in which that identity is based on interaction rather than on solitary constructions of personality.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Some of the stories may have had a Chinese origin: the very remarkable &quot;Dream of Akinosuke,&quot; for example, is certainly from a Chinese source. But the story-teller, in every case, has so recolored and reshaped his borrowing as to naturalize it&#8230; One queer tale, &quot;Yuki-Onna,&quot; was told me by a farmer of Chofu, Nishitama-gori, in Musashi province, as a legend of his native village. Whether it has ever been written in Japanese I do not know; but the extraordinary belief which it records used certainly to exist in most parts of Japan, and in many curious forms&#8230; The incident of &quot;Riki-Baka&quot; was a personal experience; and I wrote it down almost exactly as it happened, changing only a family-name mentioned by the Japanese narrator.

         "description" : "The Tales of Chekhov, Volume 01 by Anton Chekhov, Translated by Constance Garnett (Short Stories)\n\nThis is the first of thirteen volumes of Anton Chekhov&#8217;s short stories, translated by Constance Garnett.\n\nAnton Chekhov was a Russian doctor who turned to fiction as a hobby, and quickly blossomed into one of the masters of the short story genre. Though he is arguably best known for his dramatic works, such as The Cherry Orchard, his stories are widely considered to be some of the most perfect examples of short fiction ever written.\n\nConstance Black Garnett was an English housewife who taught herself Russian as a hobby, and subsequently introduced the English-speaking world to some of the greatest Russian authors, including Chekhov and Dostoevsky. Though she was almost entirely self-taught in her knowledge of Russian, she was a prolific translator, and her works are still lauded today for their readability and accuracy.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Thus Spake Zarathustra by Friedrich Nietzsche (Philosophy)\n\nFriedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche (1844&#8211;1900) was a nineteenth-century German philosopher. He wrote critical texts on religion, morality, contemporary culture, philosophy and science, using a distinctive German language style and displaying a fondness for aphorism. Nietzsche&#8217;s influence remains substantial within and beyond philosophy, notably in existentialism and postmodernism.\n\nThus Spake Zarathustra is a work composed in four parts between 1883 and 1885. Much of the work deals with ideas such as the &#8220;eternal recurrence of the same&#8221;, the parable on the &#8220;death of God&#8221;, and the &#8220;prophecy&#8221; of the Overman, which were first introduced in The Gay Science. Described by Nietzsche himself as &#8220;the deepest ever written&#8221;, the book is a dense and esoteric treatise on philosophy and morality, featuring as protagonist a fictionalized Zarathustra. A central irony of the text is that the style of the Bible is used by Nietzsche to present ideas of his which fundamentally oppose Judaeo-Christian morality and tradition.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

The charges stemmed from his affair with Lord Alfred Douglas, the son of the Marquis of Queensberry. It relates the story of an execution of a man who murdered his wife which Wilde witnessed during his internment. Published in 1898, it was Wilde&#8217;s last published poem as he would die in 1900 from cerebral menengitis, caused by syphilis.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

The name given by his parents, if one was given, is not known &#8211; the word epiktetos in Greek simply means &#8220;acquired.&#8221;\n\nEpictetus spent his youth as a slave in Rome to Epaphroditos, a very wealthy freedman of Nero. Even as a slave, Epictetus used his time productively, studying Stoic Philosophy under Musonius Rufus. He was eventually freed and lived a relatively hard life in ill health in Rome.\n\nSo far as is known, Epictetus himself wrote nothing. All that we have of his work was transcribed by his pupil Arrian. The main work is The Discourses, four books of which have been preserved (out of an original eight). Arrian also compiled a popular digest, entitled the Enchiridion, or Handbook. In a preface to the Discourses, addressed to Lucius Gellius, Arrian states that &#8220;whatever I heard him say I used to write down, word for word, as best I could, endeavouring to preserve it as a memorial, for my own future use, of his way of thinking and the frankness of his speech&#8221;.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Bible (Hebrew) 01:  Genesis by Hebrew Bible (religion)\n\nGenesis is the story of the Creation and the people that followed it. The place is Canaan which is the land of Israel and the adjoining nations. The Book discusses the complex relationship between God and Mankind and portrays the travails of one particular family, the family of Noah, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.\n\nThe book is priceless in its description of the custom of the day and the interaction within the family, tribe and Nation. But most of all the beauty of Genesis lies in the description of human behavior from its petty jealousies through unrelenting commitment for a worthy cause and love for family and friends.\n\nWe follow the trials and tribulation of the main characters as they deal with adverse circumstances and at times global annihilation. Important part of the book is also the recounting of the genealogy of the people from Adam and Eve to Joseph in Egypt. A connection is made to other different nations and tribes.\n\nThe Hebrew language is the original language of the Bible. Although Hebrew went through several transformations so far as the shape of the Alphabet, the text is consistent. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Bible (ASV) 18: The Book of Job by American Standard Version (Religion)\n\nhe Book of Job (American Standard Version) is presented in forty-two chapters and is one of the Old Testament Wisdom Books. The narrative chronicles the trials of Job as he is brought low from a comfortable and exalted position in his community to face loss of his fortune, children and health. Joined by three friends who initially commiserate and sympathize with him, there ensues a lengthy argument about the fate of the wicked and the just and much questioning about the character of God and the justice He metes out to his creations.\n\nA quite lively and poetic discussion ensues among these wise elders and their suppositions and conclusions are eventually contested by a youth who enters the discussion toward the end. God has the final word in this narrative and Job is left to abjectly acknowledge that his complaints and knowledge mean little in the face of that which is so far beyond his ability to comprehend.\n\nDebate regarding the meaning, purpose and author of this book is still hotly contested among biblical scholars. It is far beyond the scope of this summary to offer any conclusions regarding this work. The reader offers the words to the listener with no judgment or further explanation.\n\nEven without deep examination, the poetic nature of the story offers many insights into facing and overcoming adversity.",
