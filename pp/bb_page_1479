         "description" : "Golden mean to 5000 digits by Jerry Bonnell and Robert Nemiroff (Non-fiction, Science)\n\nThe golden section is a line segment sectioned into two according to the golden ratio. The total length a+b is to the longer segment a as a is to the shorter segment b. In mathematics and the arts, two quantities are in the golden ratio if the ratio between the sum of those quantities and the larger one is the same as the ratio between the larger one and the smaller. The golden ratio is a mathematical constant, approximately 1.6180339887&#8230;.\n\nAt least since the Renaissance, many artists and architects have proportioned their works to approximate the golden ratio&#8212;especially in the form of the golden rectangle, in which the ratio of the longer side to the shorter is the golden ratio&#8212;believing this proportion to be aesthetically pleasing. Mathematicians have studied the golden ratio because of its unique and interesting properties.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town by Stephen Leacock (1869-1944) (Comedy)\n\nSunshine Sketches of a Little Town is a sequence of stories by Stephen Leacock, first published in 1912. It is generally considered to be one of the most enduring classics of Canadian humorous literature.\n\nThe fictional setting for these stories is Mariposa, a small town on the shore of Lake Wissanotti. Although drawn from his experiences in Orillia, Ontario, Leacock writes in the introduction:\n\n&#8220;Mariposa is not a real town. On the contrary, it is about seventy or eighty of them. You may find them all the way from Lake Superior to the sea, with the same square streets and the same maple trees and the same churches and hotels.&#8221;\n\nThis work has remained popular for its universal appeal. Many of the characters, though modelled on townspeople of Orillia, are small town archetypes. Their shortcomings and weaknesses are presented in a humorous but affectionate way.\n\nOften, the narrator greatly exaggerates the importance of the events in Mariposa compared to the rest of the world. For example, when there is a country-wide election, &#8220;the town of Mariposa, was, of course, the storm centre and focus point of the whole turmoil.&#8221;\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.The source of the audio content is in the public domain.

         "description" : "Our Island Story, Part 2 by Henrietta Elizabeth Marshall (1867-1941) (Children, Essay/Short nonfiction, History)\n\nOur Island Story was first published in 1905 and became an instant classic. Beginning with the Romans and following the triumphs and foibles of the good, not so good and the downright despicable figures of history; we are treated to a dazzling montage of kings, queens, barons, knights, explorers, movers and shakers that have played a key role in the history of England. Marshall freely mixes folk tale with historical fact and in so doing paints a very vivid picture of the past in a style reminiscent of all that is finest in the children&#8217;s story-telling tradition. This is the second section of that work and will carry you from the convoluted and bloody &#8216;Wars of the Roses&#8217; up to the death of Queen Victoria and the resolution of the Boer War. Please be advised that this book was written in the early years of the 20th century and there will be words and phrases used then, in all innocence, that are considered politically incorrect in this age. It&#8217;s perfectly fine for children to listen to but please ensure there is someone on hand who can explain these terms in a mature fashion.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
