         "description" : "What Men Live By and Other Tales by Leo Tolstoy (Short stories)\n\nAlthough Leo Tolstoy (1828-1910) was a wealthy landowner, in his later life he had what was considered a &#8220;religious awakening.&#8221; This experience went on to inform his writing and his lifestyle in profound ways. His views transcended the specifics of religion, as known in his day &#8211; so much so he came to be a helpful guide both to Mohandas Gandhi and to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The four stories in this collection ask profound questions and gently supply helpful, non-dogmatic hints to their answerings: What is the most important thing to do? Who is the most important person? When is the most important time? What is worth owning? What is the most profound religion? What rules should men live by? How much land does a man need? Who is God? What should we bother to discuss? How should we act towards one another? How should we respond to cruelty and violence? And many more. Wonderful stories written in a relaxed style.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

He wishes to get to the town quickly &#8216;for business&#8217;. They find themselves in the middle of a blizzard, but the master in his avarice wishes to press on. They eventually get lost off the road and they try to camp. The master&#8217;s peasant soon finds himself about to die from hypothermia. The master leaves him on the horse to stubbornly try to find the road. When he returns, he attains a spiritual/moral revelation, and Tolstoy once again repeats one of his famous themes: that the only true happiness in life is found by living for others. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

The Rootabaga Stories were born of Sandburg&#8217;s desire for &#8220;American fairy tales&#8221; to match American childhood. He felt that the European stories involving royalty and knights were inappropriate, and so populated his stories with animals, skyscrapers, trains, corn fairies, and other colorful characters.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

April 1865) ist das wohl bekannteste Werk von Wilhelm Busch. Das Werk wird oft als Vorl&#228;ufer der modernen Comics bezeichnet da die zahlreichen, von Busch selbst gezeichneten Bilder, in so enger Beziehung zu dem Text stehen. In Paarreimen erz&#228;hlt die Geschichte von den b&#246;sartigen Streichen der zwei Buben Max und Moritz, deren Streiche sich haupts&#228;chlich gegen Respektspersonen der damaligen Gesellschaft richten. Diese Geschichte ist f&#252;r ein sehr junges sowohl als auch f&#252;r ein erwachsenes Publikum geeignet.

         "description" : "More Goops and How Not to Be Them by G. Burgess (Children)\n\nDeep in the heart of every parent is the wish, the desire, to have other adults tell us, in an unsolicited way, just how very polite one&#8217;s child is! This perhaps was even more the case in 1903, when Gelett Burgess produced his second book on the Goops. With entertaining cartoons &#8211; cariacatures of misbehaving children &#8211; he described many different breaches of tact and good manners.\n\nBurgess wrote several books of poetry on the Goops, each poem describing some significant way in which an unthoughtful or unkind child could offend polite society and often offering the hope that the listener would never behave that way. Ahem! Well, perhaps very few people have succeeded in not acting Goop-like at some point in their lives, but read along with Burgess as he attempts to define, in a humorous fashion, exactly what the differences between &#8220;Good&#8221; and &#8220;Goop&#8221; are!\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

In it one finds ironic derivatives (if not roots) of well known fairy tales such as &#8220;The Brave Little Taylor&#8221; and &#8220;Beauty and the Beast,&#8221; as well as some more unusual settings to impart the popular fairy tale themes of justice and happily ever after. Most stories are told with wry humor and often shocking irreverence for the expected fairy tale turn out. This is NOT a book for children, but one for adults who love fairy tales, and enjoy making fun of them.\n\nDISCLAIMER: Story 09 contains some racially offensive material in its ending.

The author describes in a fun and artistic way the conflict between an image inside of his head of the beautiful and lovely women on the one hand, and her action &#8211; smelling tobacco &#8211; on the other hand! Can anyone imagine two more incompatible things than a clean and bright woman and a dirty toy of alcoholics and sailors &#8211; tobacco! This conflict hit the author straight into his heart, so he couldn&#8217;t ignore it and wrote this amazing poem upon such a revelational theme.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Storia di un burattino &#232; il titolo del romanzo ottocentesco che ha come protagonista un notissimo personaggio di finzione, appunto Pinocchio, burattino di legno al centro di celeberrime avventure. Si tratta di un classico della cosiddetta letteratura per ragazzi e fu scritto nel 1881 da Collodi (pseudonimo dello scrittore Carlo Lorenzini).\nIl personaggio di Pinocchio &#8211; burattino umanizzato nella tendenza a nascondersi dietro facili menzogne e a cui cresce il naso in rapporto ad ogni bugia che dice &#8211; &#232; stato fatto proprio con il tempo anche dal mondo del cinema e da quello dei fumetti. Sulla sua figura sono stati inoltre realizzati album musicali e allestimenti teatrali in forma di musical.\nNelle intenzioni di Collodi pare non vi fosse quella di creare un racconto per l&#8217;infanzia: nella prima versione, infatti, il burattino moriva, impiccato a causa dei suoi innumerevoli errori. Solo nelle versioni successive, pubblicate a puntate su un quotidiano (il Giornale per bambini), la storia venne modificata con il classico finale che oggi si conosce, con il burattino che assume le fattezze di un ragazzo in carne ed ossa.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Walden by Henry David Thoreau (Non-Fiction)\n\nWalden by Henry David Thoreau is one of the best-known non-fiction books written by an American. Published in 1854, it details Thoreau&#8217;s life for two years, two months, and two days around the shores of Walden Pond. Walden is neither a novel nor a true autobiography, but a social critique of the Western World, with each chapter heralding some aspect of humanity that needed to be either renounced or praised. Along with his critique of the civilized world, Thoreau examines other issues afflicting man in society, ranging from economy and reading to solitude and higher laws. He also takes time to talk about the experience at Walden Pond itself, commenting on the animals and the way people treated him for living there, using those experiences to bring out his philosophical positions. This extended commentary on nature has often been interpreted as a strong statement to the natural religion that transcendentalists like Thoreau and Emerson were preaching.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "War Is Kind (Collection) by Stephen Crane (Poetry)\n\nPublished in 1899, just a year before his death, War Is Kind by Stephen Crane evokes again the dark imagery of war which made his fortune in The Red Badge Of Courage. Unlike that book, this collection leaves the battlefield itself behind to explore the damage war does to people&#8217;s hearts and minds. Reeking of dashed hopes, simultaneously sympathetic with the victims of war and cynical about the purposes of war, Crane implicitly criticizes the image of the romantic hero and asks if Love can survive.\n\nThe poetic voice is one of an old and wearied soul, stark and disillusioned, which is all the more intriguing since Crane was dead before he reached his 30th birthday. His work calls to mind the Beat Poets of the mid 20th century in its powerful use of language and bleak idiomatic landscape. It is poetry on the cusp of the fin de si&#232;cle; echoing the passing age and presaging the newborn century.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
