         "description" : "Tarzan of the Apes by Edgar Rice Burroughs (Adventure, Teen/Young Adult)\n\nTarzan of the Apes is Burroughs&#8217; exciting, if improbable, story of an English lord, left by the death of his stranded parents in the hands of a motherly African ape who raises him as her own. Although he is aware that he is different from the apes of his tribe, who are neither white nor hairless, he nevertheless regards them as his &#8220;people.&#8221; When older, larger, stronger apes decide that he an undesirable to be killed or expelled from the tribe, it is fortunate that Tarzan has learned the use of primitive weapons.\n\nAlthough small and weak by ape standards, Tarzan is a human of god-like strength and agility to men who discover him. By studying these people, he gradually decides he is not an ape at all, but human.\n\nAnd when he meets Jane, a beautiful American girl marooned with her father and friends on the hostile coast of Africa, Tarzan conceives love for her. When they are unexpectedly rescued before Tarzan can find a way to reveal his feelings to Jane, he determines to become civilized and follow her into the world of people &#8211; to find her and wed her, though he must cross continents and oceans, and compete with two other suitors for her hand.\n\nThis story was the subject of a successful film in 1932, with Tarzan being played by Johnny Weissmuller, who acted in a further eleven Tarzan films. According to Weissmuller in an interview with Mike Douglas, his famous ape-call was audio stitched together from a soprano, an alto, and a hog-caller\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "New Discoveries at Jamestown by John L. Cotter and J. Paul Hudson (History)\n\nChances are, you are reading this because you are aware that Jamestown, Virginia, celebrated its 400th birthday in 2007. It was the first &#8220;successful&#8221; English settlement in America. Although the colonists eventually moved upriver to be quit of the hard luck and difficult conditions on the small island, they left behind a trove of possessions &#8211; used, worn out, or forgotten.\n\nDid you ever stop to consider just how many different items you have, need, or use, to live, work, and amuse yourself? Chances are that you would seriously underestimate! But once you put such a list together, another person could tell quite a story about the life you lead.\n\nThe puzzle of archeology is how to tell that story, just from the discovery of the traces you leave behind. Literally hundreds of thousands of artifacts have been recovered from this pioneering community during three major efforts (1903, the 1950&#8217;s, and 1994-present) to reconstruct how Europeans of the early 17th century managed to transplant themselves to a wild and hostile land.\n\nThe authors, writing for the National Park Service in 1956, relate a fascinating tale of the colonists&#8217; resources, their possessions, and their manufactures. They relate documentary evidence from England, Virginia, and elsewhere, and then match it up with items found on the site.\n\nThink about packing for a trip to a new world, where you will spend the rest of your life. There are no shops, no regular supply deliveries. You will build your own home. Food is strictly grown or caught on your own. The local folks (Indians) may be (and were, at some times!) hostile to your presence. You will depend on only a few dozen other people to help you with the things you don&#8217;t know how to do, and they will depend on you. How do you prepare? What do you take?\n\nThis is that story. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

However, there is a catch &#8212; he has to spend every penny within 30 days, and end up with nothing at that time. Should he make the deadline, he stands to gain an even larger sum; should he fail, he remains penniless.\n\nBrewster finds that spending so much money is more difficult than he first thinks, especially when the lawyers are trying to make him fail so that they can claim the money. What makes it worse is that he starts to be a little too successful with some ventures, actually making money from them.\n\nCan Brewster empty his pockets in time for the deadline, or will he end the book as he started it, with nothing? \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Nothing is more simple than to realise this distinction when you do not go deeply into it; nothing is more difficult when you analyse it a little. At first sight, it seems impossible to confuse things so far apart as a thought and a block of stone; but on reflection this great contrast vanishes, and other differences have to be sought which are less apparent and of which one has not hitherto dreamed.&#8221;\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

When Great-Aunt Harriet becomes ill, poor little Elizabeth Ann is sent to live with the much-feared Putney cousins, whom, as Great-Aunt Harriet said &#8220;Such lack of sympathy, such perfect indifference to the sacred sensitiveness of child-life, such a starving of the child-heart &#8230; No, I shall never forget it! They had chores to do &#8230; as though they had been hired men!&#8221; But to the Putney cousins in Vermont Elizabeth Ann has to go. And there, with her Uncle Henry, Aunt Abigail and Cousin Ann, she grows strong and well and happy and, most importantly, learns to think for herself, and truly becomes Understood Betsy.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Focusing on problems he believes will provoke positive and constructive discussion, Russell concentrates on knowledge rather than metaphysics.\n\nRussell guides the reader through his famous distinction between &#8220;knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by description&#8221; and introduces important theories of Plato, Aristotle, Ren&#233; Descartes, David Hume, John Locke, Immanuel Kant, Georg Hegel and others, to lay the foundation for philosophical inquiry by general readers and scholars alike. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Frank Baum (Children)\n\nThe Master Key was one of Baum&#8217;s earliest full length fantasy books for children, published in 1901 just one year after The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. The protagonist, Rob, while experimenting in his workshop, accidentally summons up an electrical fairy who presents him with electrical devices so advanced as to seem magical. His gifts include a flying contraption, a stun gun, and something resembling an omniscient portable TV set. Rob travels the world, rendering assistance to European heads of state and narrowly escaping disaster at the hands of &#8220;primitive&#8221; cannibals, Turks and Tatars, pirates, and evil scientists who try to steal his inventions. It&#8217;s great fun, despite the occasional use of racial stereotypes that reflect the values of its time. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Arabian Nights Entertainments, Volume 01 by Anonymous &#8211; translated by Dr. Jonathan Scott. \n(Adventure, Fairy tales, Myths/Legends, Short stories)\n\nThe main frame story concerns a king and his new bride. The king, Shahryar, upon discovering his ex-wife&#8217;s infidelity executes her and then declares all women to be unfaithful. He begins to marry a succession of virgins only to execute each one the next morning. Scheherazade agrees to marry him and each night, beginning on the night of their marriage, she tells the king a tale but does not end it so that the king keeps her alive in order to hear the next tale. The stories proceed from this original tale; some are framed within other tales, while others begin and end of their own accord. Some editions contain only a few hundred tales, while others include 1001 or more stories and &#8220;nights.&#8221;\n\nWell known stories from the Nights include Aladdin, Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves, and The Seven Voyages of Sinbad the Sailor.

         "description" : "For the Term of His Natural Life by Marcus Clarke (Historical Fiction)\n\nFor the Term of his Natural Life, written by Marcus Clarke, was published in the Australian Journal between 1870 and 1872 (as His Natural Life), appearing as a novel in 1874. It is the best known novelisation of life as a convict in early Australian history. Described as a &#8220;ripping yarn&#8221;, and at times relying on seemingly implausible coincidences, the story follows the fortunes of Rufus Dawes, a young man transported for a murder which he did not commit. The harsh and inhumane treatment meted out to the convicts, some of whom were transported for relatively minor crimes, is clearly conveyed. The conditions experienced by the convicts are graphically described. The novel was based on research by the author as well as a visit to the penal settlement of Port Arthur, Tasmania.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Folklore of the Santal Parganas by Cecil Henry Bompas (Children, Fairy tales, Animals, Short stories)\n\nThis is an intriguing collection of folklore from the Santal Parganas, a district in India located about 150 miles from Calcutta. As its Preface implies, this collection is intended to give an unadulterated view of a culture through its folklore. It contains a variety of stories about different aspects of life, including family and marriage, religion, and work. In this first volume, taken from Part I, each story is centered around a particular human character. These range from the charmingly clever (as in the character, The Oilman, in the story, &#8220;The Oilman and His Sons&#8221;) to the tragically comical (as in the character, Jhore, in the story &#8220;Bajun and Jhore&#8221;). In later parts, the stories will focus on other subjects, including spirits, animals, and legends from this culture.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
