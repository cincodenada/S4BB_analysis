         "description" : "De Leeuw van Vlaenderen of de Slag der Gulden Sporen by Hendrik Conscience (Historical Fiction) (Dutch)\n\nEen historische roman vol ridders, dappere burgers, vaderlandsliefde en veel geweld; dit alles speelt zich af in Vlaanderen in 1302. Vlaanderen is in de handen van de Fransen gevallen, en de Vlaamse vorst en zijn oudste zoon (Robrecht van Bethune, oftewel de Leeuw van Vlaenderen) zijn in gevangenschap in Frankrijk. Uit het volk staan echter twee nieuwe leiders op, om het land te helpen bevrijden van het Franse juk. De strijd mondt uit in de Guldensporenslag, 11 juli 1302, waarin een Vlaams leger van voetknechten tegenover een Frans ridderleger komt te staan. Door het verhaal heen loopt de romance tussen ridder Adolf van Nieuwland en Machteld, de dochter van Robrecht van Bethune.\n\nA historic novel about the &#8220;Battle of the Golden Spurs&#8221;, in 1302 in Flanders, and the events leading up to it. The story is laced with a romance between the knight Adolf van Nieuwland and Machteld, daugher of Robrecht van Bethune (also known as &#8220;The Lion of Flanders&#8221;).\nConscience wanted to make his Flemish fellow-countrymen aware of their national identity and feeling of self-worth (shortly after Belgium gained independence). As a consequence of the huge success of this book, Conscience became known as &#8220;the man who taught his people how to read.&#8221; \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Miscellaneous Pieces by John Bunyan (Religion)\n\nJohn Bunyan (November 28, 1628 &#8211; August 31, 1688), a Christian writer and preacher, was born at Harrowden (one mile south-east of Bedford), in the Parish of Elstow, England. He wrote The Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress, arguably the most famous published Christian allegory. In the Church of England he is remembered with a Lesser Festival on 30 August.\n\nBunyan became a popular preacher as well as a prolific author, though most of his works consist of expanded sermons. In theology he was a Puritan, but there was nothing gloomy about him. The portrait his friend Robert White drew, which has often been reproduced, shows the attractiveness of his true character.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Moral Equivalent of War by William James (Philosophy, Politics)\n\nThe Moral Equivalent of War, the last public utterance of William James, is significant as expressing the opinions of a practical psychologist on a question of growing popular interest. For the past fifteen years the movement for promoting international peace has been enlisting the support of organizations and individuals the world over. That this is a question on which much may be said for the opposition, James, though a pacificist, admits with his usual fair-mindedness, pointing out that militarism is the sole nourisher of certain human virtues that the world cannot let die, and that until the peace party devises some substitute, some moral equivalent, for the disciplinary value of war, their utopian goal is neither desirable nor possible. His own solution is advanced not as a practical measure, but merely as an illustration to show that the world is full of opportunities for the peaceful development and continuation of the martial qualities of human life.\n\nThis essay was written for general dissemination as a publication of the American Association for International Conciliation, February, 1910. As it not only presents a peace program but defines as well the most familiar arguments of the war party, no militarist article has been included, although it may be mentioned that a suggestive apology for war is to be found among De Quincey&#8217;s Essays and also in Ruskin&#8217;s Crown of Wild Olive. Additional documents on conciliation, approaching the question from innumerable points of view, are published by the Association mentioned above.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Voyage Out by Virginia Woolf ( Literature, Satire )\n\nThe Voyage Out is the first novel by Virginia Woolf, published in 1915 by Duckworth; and published in the U.S. in 1920 by Doran. One of Woolf&apos;s wittiest social satires.\n\nRachel Vinrace embarks for South America on her father&apos;s ship and is launched on a course of self-discovery in a kind of modern mythical voyage. The mismatched jumble of passengers provide Woolf with an opportunity to satirize Edwardian life. The novel introduces Clarissa Dalloway, the central character of Woolf&apos;s later novel, Mrs. Dalloway.\n\nE. M. Forster described it as &quot;... a strange, tragic, inspired book whose scene is a South America not found on any map and reached by a boat which would not float on any sea, an America whose spiritual boundaries touch Xanadu and Atlantis... It is absolutely unafraid... Here at last is a book which attains unity as surely as Wuthering Heights, though by a different path.&quot;\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
