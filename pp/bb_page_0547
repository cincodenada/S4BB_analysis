         "description" : "Domestic Cookery, Useful Receipts, and Hints to Young Housekeepers by Elizabeth E. Lea (1793-1858) (Cookery, Advice, Instruction)\n\nThe compiler of (this book) having entered early in life upon a train of duties, was frequently embarrassed by her ignorance of domestic affairs. For, whilst receipt books for elegant preparations were often seen, those connected with the ordinary, but far more useful part of household duties, were not easily procured; thus situated, she applied to persons of experience, and embodied the information collected in a book, to which, since years have matured her judgment, she has added much that is the result of her own experiments.\n\nFamiliar, then, with the difficulties a young housekeeper encounters, when she finds herself in reality the mistress of an establishment, the Authoress offers to her young countrywomen this Work, with the belief that, by attention to its contents, many of the cares attendant on a country or city life, may be materially lessened; and hoping that the directions are such as to be understood by the most inexperienced, it is respectfully dedicated to those who feel an interest in domestic affairs.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

The meeting was to be held in New York City in October. Representatives from nine colonies met in New York. Though New Hampshire, Virginia, North Carolina and Georgia did not send delegates, the Assemblies of those missing colonies nonetheless agreed to support the works of the Congress. The meetings were held in Federal Hall in New York, and the delegates assembled on October 2. They spent less than two weeks in discussion and at their final meeting on October 19, 1765 adopted the Declaration of Rights and approved its use in petitions to the King and two letters to Parliament. The Declaration of Rights and Grievances raised thirteen points of colonial protest.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Sky Island by L. Frank Baum (1856-1919) (Children, Adventure, Fantasy)\n\nSky Island (1912) was the second of three titles written by Baum featuring a spunky girl from California, Trot, and her companion, the old sailorman, Cap&#8217;n Bill. Baum had hoped to end the Oz series in 1910 and the following year he introduced Trot and Cap&#8217;n Bill in The Sea Fairies. In Sky Island, they journey to an island in the sky by means of an enchanted umbrella belonging to Button Bright, a character who first appeared in The Road to Oz (1909). The trio is then captured by the Boolaroo of the Blues, a monarch who is both comical and dangerous, escape to the country of the &#8220;Pinks&#8221;, and eventually regain the magic umbrella and return back to earth. This is one of Baum&#8217;s best fantasy books and contains enough not-so-veiled commentary on race and politics to interest adults as well. However, it (and The Sea Fairies) did not sell as well as the Oz books and Baum resumed writing them in 1913. He subsequently brought Trot and Cap&#8217;n Bill to Oz in 1915 in The Scarecrow of Oz.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

The first two play out in what used to be areas of working class quarters and give an insight into the lives of the people at the time. The third talks about the change Maastricht underwent when it stopped being a fortified city and lost most of its defenses, some of which date back to medieval times.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde (Horror, Ghost Stories)\n\nDorian Gray, a young man of wealth and stature in late 1800&#8217;s London, meets Lord Henry Wotton while posing for a portrait by his friend Basil Hallward. Once the painting is complete, Dorian realizes that it will always be young and attractive, while he will be forced to age and wither with the years. Carelessly, he wishes the opposite were true. What happens is a treatise on morals, self-indulgence and how crucial personal responsibility is towards one&#8217;s self. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Father Brown&#8217;s ability to uncover the truth behind the mystery continually surpasses that of the &#8220;experts&#8221; around him, who are fooled into underestimation by the priest&#8217;s unimpressive outward appearance and, often, by their own prejudices about Christianity.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
