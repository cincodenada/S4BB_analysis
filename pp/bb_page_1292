         "description" : "Cuore by Edmondo De Amicis (Children) (Italian)\n\nENGLISH: \nHeart (Italian: Cuore) was a children&#8217;s novel written by Italian author Edmondo De Amicis. It is set during the Italian unification, and includes several patriotic themes. It was issued by Treves on October 17, 1886, the first day of school in Italy, and rose to immediate success.\n\nThe novel is written in a diary form as told by Enrico Bottini, a 10-year old primary school student in Italy with an upper class background who is surrounded by classmates of working class origin. The entire chronological setting corresponds to the third-grade season.\n\nEnrico&#8217;s parents and older siblings sometimes correspond with Enrico through the means of his diary: his teacher assigns him with homework dealing with stories of children throughout the Italian states, who should serve as role models &#8211; the stories are then given in full as Enrico is supposed to have written them. Most topics revolve around moral values, and the predilect ones include helping those in need, love for family and friends, and patriotism.\n\nITALIAN: \nCuore &#232; un romanzo scritto nel 1886 da Edmondo de Amicis, pubblicato nel 1888.\n\nFu un grande successo, tanto che de Amicis divenne lo scrittore pi&#249; letto d&#8217;Italia.

         "description" : "Greener Than You Think by Ward Moore (Horror/Ghost stories, Science fiction, Satire)\n\nDo remember reading a panic-mongering news story a while back about genetically engineered &#8220;Frankengrass&#8221; &#8220;escaping&#8221; from the golf course where it had been planted? That news story was foreshadowed decades previously in the form of prophetic fiction wherein a pushy salesman, a cash-strapped scientist, and a clump of crabgrass accidentally merge forces with apocalyptic consequences. A triple-genre combo of science fiction, horror, and satire, Greener Than You Think is a forgotten classic that resonates beautifully with modern times. This is a faithful reading of a 1947 first edition text.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

The character of Professor Challenger was introduced in this book. Interestingly, for a seminal work of dinosaur-related fiction, the reptiles only occupy a small portion of the narrative. Much more time is devoted to a war between early human hominids and a vicious tribe of ape-like creatures. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Edgar Allan Poe Poems by Edgar Allan Poe (Poetry)\n\nEdgar Allan Poe (1809 &#8211; 1849) is widely famed as one of the greatest writers of all time. He is best known for his works of horror, such as &#8220;The Tell Tale Heart.&#8221; However, and this is less known, Poe also wrote many love poems. In this collection of forty-eight poems by Edgar Allan Poe we will go through a wide variety of themes, from horror and raw creepiness in &#8220;The Raven&#8221; to pure love in &#8220;A Valentine&#8221; to depression in &#8220;Alone.&#8221; Throughout all of his poems Poe kept a very strong meter and rhyme scheme. This is most obvious in &#8220;The Bells.&#8221; \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

It is a general epistle, that is, a letter meant to be circulated and read in all the early Christian churches. Although brief, the content of the book is dense. Many examples of evildoers and strong warnings about their fates are given in rapid succession. The dispute over the body of Moses and the prophecies of Enoch are mentioned in no other book in the Bible. The doxology, or hymn of praise, at the end of the book is particularly beautiful.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Hard Times by Charles Dickens (Satire)\n\nHard Times, the shortest of Dickens&#8217;s full-length novels, is set in the fictitious Victorian-England city of Coketown, where facts are the rule and all fancy is to be stamped out. The plot centers around the men and women of the town, some of whom are beaten down by the city&#8217;s utilitarian ideals and some of whom manage to rise above it. The novel was written in 1854 and was a scathing attack on then-current ideas of utilitarianism, which Dickens viewed as a selfish and at times oppressive philosophy. Perhaps the novel&#8217;s best features are its clever, ironic narration and the larger-than-life characters that push the plot forward, such as the upper-class banker and hypocritical braggart, Josiah Bounderby, and the fact-driven schoolmaster, Thomas Gradgrind.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Little Men by Louisa May Alcott (Children)\n\nLittle Men (published 1871) is considered the second book of the Little Women trilogy written by Louisa May Alcott. (The book Good Wives (1869) was originally the sequel to the novel Little Women (1868), however those two novels are now usually published as a single volume.) The final book of the trilogy is Jo&#8217;s Boys (1886).\n\nLittle Men follows the life of Jo Bhaer and the students who live and learn at the Plumfield Estate School that she runs with her husband. The mischievous kids, whom she loves and cares for as her own, learn valuable lessons as they become proper gentlemen and ladies. We also get cameo appearances of almost all the characters found in the previous books, almost all of them happy and well. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
