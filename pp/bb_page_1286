         "description" : "From October to Brest-Litovsk by Leon Trotsky (History, War Stories)\n\nThis account by Trotsky is of the events in Russia from the October Revolution of 1917 in Petrograd, to his signing of the Brest-Litovsk treaty with Germany on 3rd March 1918 which took Russia out of the First World War. The treaty exacted heavy losses for Russia in terms of annexations of land and financial indemnities to Germany. In this extended essay, Trotsky argues the reasons as to why he decided to sign what appears to be a disastrous agreement for Russia.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Henry while in prison. He published 10 collections and over 600 short stories during his lifetime.\n\nThe Four Million is the second book written by O. Henry while he served time for embezzlement in a penitentiary in Ohio. The book is a series of short stories which take place in New York City in the early years of the 20th century and are representative of the surprise endings that popularized O. Henry&#8217;s work. They also capture his use of coincidence or chance to create humor in the story. O Henry wrote about ordinary people in everyday circumstances. He is quoted as once saying, &#8220;There are stories in everything. I&#8217;ve got some of my best yarns from park benches, lampposts and newspaper stands.&#8221;\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Heidi by Johanna Spyri (Children)\n\nHear Heidi if you&#8217;ve ever longed to see the Swiss mountain slopes. This story transports the listener from the fine air and freedom of the mountaintop to the confines of Frankfurt, back to the peaks again, bounding in flowered fields with goats at your heels and sky utterly surrounding you.\n\nWe meet Heidi when she is 5, led up the mountain by her aunt who has raised the orphan but must leave now for a position in Frankfurt. In a mountain cottage overlooking the valley is Heidi&#8217;s grandfather, and there with him the girl&#8217;s sweet, free nature expands with the vista. The author&#8217;s voice is straightforward, and so is our reader&#8217;s, with the child&#8217;s wonder, devotion, and sometimes humorous good intentions. When Heidi is taken from the mountains and nearly doesn&#8217;t make it back again, the most humorous as well as most heart-wringing scenes occur. All she learns during her absence from the mountain she brings back as seeds that will grow to benefit everyone around her. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Antichrist by Friedrich Nietzsche (Philosophy)\n\nSave for his raucous, rhapsodical autobiography, Ecce Homo, The Antichrist is the last thing that Nietzsche ever wrote, and so it may be accepted as a statement of some of his most salient ideas in their final form. Of all Nietzsche&#8217;s books, The Antichrist comes nearest to conventionality in form. It presents a connected argument with very few interludes, and has a beginning, a middle and an end.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Life of Charlemagne by Einhard (History)\n\nEinhard was employed by Charlemagne as a court historian. At the request of Charlemagne&#8217;s son and successor Louis the Pious, he wrote a biography of Charlemagne, the Vita Karoli Magni or Life of Charlemagne (c. 817&#8211;830), which provides much direct information about Charlemagne&#8217;s life and character. In composing this he made full use of the Frankish Royal annals. Einhard&#8217;s literary model was the classical work of the Roman historian Suetonius, the Lives of the Caesars.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Bible (KJV) NT 03: Luke by James King (Religion)\n\nThe Gospel of Luke is the most literary of the four gospels which recount the life and work of Jesus Christ. Although anonymous, the book is generally attributed to Luke, a physician and a missionary companion of the Apostle Paul. His account contains events which are unique in the four gospels including the visits of Gabriel to Mary and Zacharias, the visit of the shepherds to the birth of Jesus, and the story of the young Jesus at the temple. This gospel contains the most references to women and is favorable to the Gentiles for whom it was written. Perhaps the most well-known of all New Testament passages is the second chapter of Luke which tells of the birth of Christ.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Road by Siegfried Sassoon (Poetry)\n\nSiegfried Loraine Sassoon was an English poet, author and soldier. Decorated for bravery on the Western Front, he became one of the leading poets of the First World War. His poetry both described the horrors of the trenches, and satirised the patriotic pretensions of those who, in Sassoon&apos;s view, were responsible for a vainglorious war. He later won acclaim for his prose work, notably his three-volume fictionalised autobiography, collectively known as the &quot;Sherston Trilogy&quot;.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
