         "description" : "Selected Poems by Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell (Poetry)\n\nPoems by Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell was a volume of poetry published jointly by the three Bronte sisters, Charlotte, Emily and Anne in 1846, and their first work to ever go in print. To evade contemporary prejudice against female writers, the Bronte sisters adopted androgynous first names. Marked by profound sentiments, gravity and melodious harmony, the poems are strewn on the fields of soulful love, rueful reminiscence and the immortal yearnings of a Christian soul, and represent a fragrant assemblage of noetic flowers from the glebes of olden England. For those not familiar with the Bronte sisters&#8217; poetry, it should be noted that many of their poems were written in the context of their fictional, shared worlds of Gondal and Angria.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Holy Sonnets by John Donne (Religion, Poetry)\n\nJohn Donne (1572 &#8211; March 31, 1631) was a Jacobean poet and preacher, representative of the metaphysical poets of the period. His works, notable for their realistic and sensual style, include sonnets, love poetry, religious poems, Latin translations, epigrams, elegies, songs, satires and sermons. His poetry is noted for its vibrancy of language and immediacy of metaphor, compared with that of his contemporaries.\n\nTowards the end of his life Donne wrote works that challenged death, and the fear that it inspired in many men, on the grounds of his belief that those who die are sent to Heaven to live eternally. One example of this challenge is his Holy Sonnet X, from which come the famous lines &#8220;Death, be not proud, though some have called thee mighty and dreadful, for thou art not so.&#8221;\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Theory of Social Revolutions by Brooks Adams (Politics, History)\n\nBrooks Adams (1848- 1927), was an American historian and a critic of capitalism. He believed that commercial civilizations rise and fall in predictable cycles. First, masses of people draw together in large population centers and engage in commercial activities. As their desire for wealth grows, they discard spiritual and creative values. Their greed leads to distrust and dishonesty, and eventually the society crumbles. In The Law of Civilisation and Decay (1895), Adams noted that as new population centers emerged in the west, centers of world trade shifted from Constantinople to Venice to Amsterdam to London. He predicted in America&#8217;s Economic Supremacy (1900) that New York would become the centre for world trade.\n\nThe Theory of Social Revolutions was written in 1913. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

It&#8217;s not enough that the remaining residents of Earth have pinned their last hope of salvation on him and his mission. He has to find a colony that presumedly was established at an unknown star two centuries before and beg their help. But first, he has the small matter of a mutiny on board his starship, and people are trying to kill him!\n\nWritten in an era when radios used vacuum tubes, the scientific component of the story is quaint and dated. But Laumer makes the centerpiece of his tale the retelling of how, four years out on the voyage, his crew decides it wants to give up and go home when it meets an alien race&#8230; that apparently breeds humans in captivity as food animals!\n\nBeating the aliens, shanghaiing the crew, finding the colony and saving Mother Earth &#8211; just the ingredients for a rattling good yarn! \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
