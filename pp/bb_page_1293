         "description" : "Marius the Epicurean &#8211; Volume 1 by Walter Pater (Philosophy)\n\nMarius the Epicurean is a philosophical novel written by Walter Pater, published in 1885. In it Pater displays, with fullness and elaboration, his ideal of the aesthetic life, his cult of beauty as opposed to bare asceticism, and his theory of the stimulating effect of the pursuit of beauty as an ideal of its own. The principles of what would be known as the Aesthetic movement were partly traceable to this book; and its impact was particularly felt on one of the movement&#8217;s leading proponents, Oscar Wilde, a former student of Pater at Oxford. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Washington Square by Henry James (Literature)\n\nWashington Square is a short novel by Henry James. Originally published in 1880 as a serial in Cornhill Magazine and Harper&#8217;s New Monthly Magazine, it is a structurally simple tragicomedy that recounts the conflict between a dull but sweet daughter and her brilliant, domineering father.\n\nThe book is often compared to Jane Austen&#8217;s work for the clarity and grace of its prose and its intense focus on family relationships. James was hardly a great admirer of Jane Austen, so he might not have regarded the comparison as flattering. In fact, James was not a great fan of Washington Square itself. He tried to read it over for inclusion in the New York Edition of his fiction (1907-1909) but found that he couldn&#8217;t, and the novel was not included. Other readers, though, have sufficiently enjoyed the book to make it one of the more popular works of the Jamesian canon. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Eye-searing lances of energy lashed back and forth across the base with methodical accuracy. And a single cowering witness, flattened on a ledge in the heights above, knew that when the last of those yellow-red bolts fell, nothing human would be left alive down there. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Love and Freindship by Jane Austen (Epistolary fiction, Humor, Satire, Romance, Teen/Young adult)\n\nLove and Freindship is a juvenile story by Jane Austen, dated 1790, when Austen was 14 years old. Love and Freindship (the misspelling is one of many in the story) is clearly a parody of romantic novels Austen read as a child. This is clear even from the subtitle, &#8220;Deceived in Freindship and Betrayed in Love,&#8221; which neatly undercuts the title.\n\nWritten in epistolary form, it resembles a fairy tale as much as anything else, featuring wild coincidences and turns of fortune, but Austen is determined to lampoon the conventions of romantic stories, right down to the utter failure of romantic fainting spells, which always turn out dreadfully for the female characters.\n\nIn this story one can see the development of Austen&#8217;s sharp wit and disdain for romantic sensibility, so characteristic of her later novels.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Utilitarianism by John Stuart Mill (Philopsophy)\n\nJohn Stuart Mill&#8217;s book Utilitarianism is one of the most influential and widely-read philosophical defenses of utilitarianism in ethics. The essay first appeared as a series of three articles published in Fraser&#8217;s Magazine in 1861; the articles were collected and reprinted as a single book in 1863. It went through four editions during Mill&#8217;s lifetime with minor additions and revisions.\n\nAlthough Mill includes discussions of utilitarian ethical principles in other works such as On Liberty and The Subjection of Women, Utilitarianism contains Mill&#8217;s only major discussion of the fundamental grounds for utilitarian ethical theory. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

It is usually described as one of Tolstoy&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s two major masterpieces (the other being Anna Karenina) as well as one of the world&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s greatest novels.\n\nWar and Peace offered a new kind of fiction, with a great many characters caught up in a plot that covered nothing less than the grand subjects indicated by the title, combined with the equally large topics of youth, age and marriage. While today it is considered a novel, it broke so many novelistic conventions of its day that many critics of Tolstoy&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s time did not consider it as such. Tolstoy himself considered Anna Karenina (1878) to be his first attempt at a novel in the European sense.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions by Edwin Abbott Abbott (Fiction, Science fiction, Satire)\n\nFlatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions is an 1884 science fiction novella by the English schoolmaster Edwin Abbott Abbott. As a satire, Flatland offered pointed observations on the social hierarchy of Victorian culture. However, the novella&#226;&#128;&#153;s more enduring contribution is its examination of dimensions; in a foreword to one of the many publications of the novella, noted science writer Isaac Asimov described Flatland as &#226;&#128;&#156;The best introduction one can find into the manner of perceiving dimensions.&#226;&#128;&#157; As such, the novella is still popular amongst mathematics, physics and computer science students.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Merchant of Venice by William Shakespeare\n\t\t\nWilliam Shakespeare&apos;s The Merchant of Venice was probably written between 1596 and 1598, and was printed with the comedies in the First Folio of 1623. Bassanio, an impoverished gentleman, uses the credit of his friend, the merchant Antonio, to borrow money from a wealthy Jew, Shylock. Antonio pledges to pay Shylock a pound of flesh if he defaults on the loan, which Bassanio will use to woo a rich heiress, Portia. A subplot concerns the elopement of Shylock&apos;s daughter Jessica with a Christian, Bassanio&apos;s friend Lorenzo. In its focus on love and marriage, the play shares certain concerns with Shakespeare&apos;s other comedies. Yet its depiction of the tensions between Jews and Christians in early modern Venice - and its highly dramatic trial scene in Act 4 - create darker currents in the play.\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
