It was first published by John Day, in 1563. Lavishly illustrated with many woodcuts, it was the largest publishing project undertaken in Britain up to that time. Commonly known as, &#8220;Foxe&#8217;s Book of Martyrs&#8221;, the work&#8217;s full title begins with &#8220;Actes and Monuments of these Latter and Perillous Days, Touching Matters of the Church.&#8221; There were many subsequent editions, by Day, and by other editors down through the years. Foxe&#8217;s original work was enormous (the second edition filling two heavy folio volumes with a total of 2,300 pages, estimated to be twice as long as Edward Gibbon&#8217;s &#8220;Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.&#8221; This edition is much abridged from Foxe&#8217;s original. (Summary from Wikipedia)\n\nProofed by Heart of Texas, coordinated and produced by Karen Merline.\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge, Part 1 by George Berkeley\n\t\t\nA Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge, Part 1 (Commonly called &#8220;Treatise&#8221; when referring to Berkeley&#8217;s works) is a 1710 work by the Irish Empiricist philosopher George Berkeley. It largely seeks to refute the claims made by his contemporary John Locke about the nature of human perception. Both Locke and Berkeley agreed that there was an outside world, and it was this world which caused the ideas one has within one&#8217;s mind. Berkeley sought to prove that the outside world was also composed solely of ideas, suggesting that &#8220;Ideas can only resemble Ideas&#8221;. This world was given logic and regularity by some other force, which Berkeley concluded was God.\n\nPart 2 of the Treatise was never written.\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "United States Historical Documents (History)\n\nThe Articles of Confederation: On November 15th, 1777 The Articles of Confederation became the first constitution of the United States, though not yet ratified by the thirteen original colonies. Ratification of the Articles took place almost three and a half years later on March 1st, 1781. The purpose of the articles was to create a confederation of sovereign states with a weak central government; thus allowing state governments to wield most of the power. It wasn&#8217;t long before the need for a stronger federal government was realized which led to the Articles being replaced by the United States Constitution. The Articles of Confederation is the common term for The Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union.\n\nThe U.S. Constitution: The United States Constitution is the legal backbone of the United States of America and comprises the basic laws of the United States Federal Government. Delegates from twelve of the thirteen original colonies put the Constitution&#8217;s frame work together in May 1787 in Philadelphia. The Constitution defines the three branches of government and their jurisdictions; they are the Executive Branch (President/Vice President), Legislative Branch (Congress comprised of the Senate &amp; House of Representatives), and the Judicial Branch (the Supreme Court). The need for three branches of government was to create a separation of powers so that not one person or group has full responsibilities, but that they&#8217;re spread out and each branch must refer to the other by a means of checks and balances.\n\nThe Declaration of Independence: The Declaration of Independence is a document that is the epitome of freedom and liberty. It was drafted by Thomas Jefferson in 1776 as a list of grievances against the King of England, George III. The Declaration expresses the conviction of Americans in a philosophy of self-evident truths of what individual liberty and freedom should be. The Declaration was the beginning to separation from England and the catalyst for a birth of a nation.\n\nThe Gettysburg Address: The Gettysburg Address is considered one of the greatest and most quoted speeches of a President throughout American history. President Abraham Lincoln gave his address on the battlefield at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania on November 19th, 1863. It was a few months after the battle at Gettysburg was over, the purpose of Lincoln being there was to consecrate a cemetery to the fallen Union soldiers of the Civil War. It is believed that Lincoln&#8217;s main goal of this opportunity was to fight for the United States as a united country and to express the equality of all under the law\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

When Howells became editor a few years later, The Atlantic Monthly began serializing many of Twain&#8217;s works, among them his non-fiction masterpiece, Life on the Mississippi.\n\nIn My Mark Twain, Howells pens a literary memoir that includes such fascinating scenes as their meetings with former president Ulysses Grant who was then writing the classic autobiography that Twain would underwrite in the largest publishing deal until that time. But it is also notable for its affectionate descriptions of his friend&#8217;s family life during Howells&#8217; many visits to the Twain residences in Hartford and Stormfield.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Gettysburg Address by Abraham Lincoln (History)\n\nIt was a cloudy November day in 1863 when thousands gathered to hear renowned orator Edward Everett dedicate a national cemetary at the site of a pivotal battle early in July of that year. Also present to deliver &#8220;a few appropriate remarks&#8221; was the President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln spoke but 278 words; Everett later wrote to the President, &#8220;I should be glad, if I could flatter myself that I came as near to the central idea of the occasion, in two hours, as you did in two minutes.&#8221; Though there are surviving transcripts of Everett&#8217;s lengthly speech, it is Lincoln&#8217;s words which have come to be known as &#8220;The Gettysburg Address&#8221;.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Rambunctious, book worm, Jo, who wants to become a writer and wishes she were born a boy. Shy and quiet, homeloving, Beth, who loves to play the piano and play with her kitties. Finally, the youngest, artistic, Amy, who longs for an aristocratic nose!\n\nThe story takes place during the American Civil War, and begins with Mr. March away from home as a chaplain to the Union army, while his wife and daughters remain at home to work and wait for his safe return. This book follows their joys and sorrows and scrapes along the path to the girl&#8217;s becoming grown up &#8220;little women&#8221;.\n\nMany of the scrapes they get into include Laurie&#8211;their harum scarum next door neighbor, who becomes their adopted brother. The two families, the March&#8217;s and the Laurence&#8217;s strike up a lasting friendship, despite their differences in material possessions.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
