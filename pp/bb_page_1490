Meantime within man is the soul of the whole; the wise silence; the universal beauty, to which every part and particle is equally related, the eternal ONE. And this deep power in which we exist and whose beatitude is all accessible to us, is not only self-sufficing and perfect in every hour, but the act of seeing and the thing seen, the seer and the spectacle, the subject and the object, are one. We see the world piece by piece, as the sun, the moon, the animal, the tree; but the whole, of which these are shining parts, is the soul&#8221;.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Glugs of Gosh by C. J. Dennis  (Poetry)\n\nFirst published in 1917, The Glugs of Gosh satirizes Australian life at the start of the twentieth century &#8211; but the absurdities it catalogs seem just as prevalent at the start of the twenty-first. The foolishness of kings, the arrogance of the elite, the gullibility of crowds, the pride of the self-righteous, the unthinking following of tradition &#8211; all find themselves the targets of C. J. Dennis&#8217; biting wit.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Imitation of Christ by Thomas a Kempis (Non-Fiction)\n\nThe Imitation of Christ is widely considered one of the greatest manuals of devotion in Christianity. The life of Christ is presented as the highest study possible to a mortal, as Jesus&#8217; teachings far excel all the teachings of the saints. The book gives counsel to read the scriptures, statements about the uses of adversity, advice for submission to authority, warnings against temptation and how to resist it, reflections about death and the judgment, meditations upon the oblation of Christ, and admonitions to flee the vanities of the world.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

He touches on the changes time has brought about in the city, education, and work habits. Among the other topics in this work are nature, fishing, gardening, success, and spirits&#8211;both of the departed and of the variety Prohibition prohibited.\n\nEach chapter of this book is a standalone story and if you love a good laugh, these stories are for you. In me, Leacock&#8217;s wit produced the full range of laughter: smiles, chuckles, guffaws, and some uncontrollable giggles. Also, occasionally, I found myself shedding a tear or two.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Relativity: The Special and General Theory by Albert Einstein (Science)\n\nThis is an introduction to Einstein&#8217;s space-bending, time-stretching theory of Relativity, written by the master himself. Special and General relativity explain the structure of space time and provide a theory of gravitation, respectively. Einstein&#8217;s theories shocked the world with their counterintuitive results, including the dissolution of absolute time. In this book he brings a simplified form of his profound understanding of the subject to the layperson. In the words of Einstein: &#8220;The present book is intended, as far as possible, to give an exact insight into the theory of Relativity to those readers who, from a general scientific and philosophical point of view, are interested in the theory, but who are not conversant with the mathematical apparatus of theoretical physics.&#8221; The book is challenging at times but, when approached patiently, proves itself one of the most lucid explanations of Relativity to be found anywhere. !(Due to transcription or optical character recognition errors in creating online texts, and because of less-than-clear fonts in some printed texts, the variables as read in some of the equations here are not as Einstein intended. For example, the numeral &apos;one&apos; has frequently been printed and read as the letter &apos;I.&apos; In addition, some equations do not translate well into the spoken word. If you require completely accurate renditions of Einstein&apos;s mathematical formulas, we suggest that you consult a published text.)\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

In the words of the authors, &#8220;It is designed in these pages to bring the reader face to face with Edison; to glance at an interesting childhood and a youthful period marked by a capacity for doing things, and by an insatiable thirst for knowledge; then to accompany him into the great creative stretch of forty years, during which he has done so much. This book shows him plunged deeply into work for which he has always had an incredible capacity, reveals the exercise of his unsurpassed inventive ability, his keen reasoning powers, his tenacious memory, his fertility of resource; follows him through a series of innumerable experiments, conducted methodically, reaching out like rays of search-light into all the regions of science and nature, and finally exhibits him emerging triumphantly from countless difficulties bearing with him in new arts the fruits of victorious struggle.&#8221;\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

She and her husband moved to Belleville in 1840, which she referred to as &#8220;the clearings&#8221;. Here she described urban life, including religion, art, and education, especially as compared to relative lack of these things in &#8220;the bush&#8221;. She studied the Family Compact and became sympathetic to the moderate reformers led by Robert Baldwin, while remaining critical of radical reformers such as William Lyon Mackenzie. This caused problems for her husband, who shared her views, but, as sheriff of Belleville, had to work with members and supporters of the Family Compact.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Paradise Lost by John Milton (Religion, Poetry)\n\nParadise Lost is the first epic of English literature written in the classical style. John Milton saw himself as the intellectual heir of Homer, Virgil, and Dante, and sought to create a work of art which fully represented the most basic tenets of the Protestant faith. His work, which was dictated from memory and transcribed by his daughter, remains as one of the most powerful English poems. (Summary by Caeristhiona)\n\nThis is a recording of the text of Milton&#8217;s first edition of 1667, which had ten books, unlike the second edition (1674) which was redivided into twelve books in the manner of Virgil&#8217;s Aeneid.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
