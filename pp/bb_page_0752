         "description" : "Has a Frog a Soul by Thomas H. Huxley (Essay)\n\nThomas Huxley, known as &#8220;Darwin&#8217;s Bulldog&#8221; for his championing and development of Darwinism, was perhaps the most important Victorian biologist after Darwin himself. This speech to the Metaphysical Society in 1870 is one of Huxley&#8217;s best known texts outside the sphere of his specialism, and remains read today by students of philosophy. In it, Huxley argues from the results of vivisection to metaphysics.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Bleak House by Charles Dickens (Novel)\n\nBleak House is the ninth novel by Charles Dickens, published in 20 monthly parts between March 1852 and September 1853. It is widely held to be one of Dickens&#8217; finest and most complete novels, containing one of the most vast, complex and engaging arrays of minor characters and sub-plots in his entire canon. Dickens tells all of these both through the narrative of the novel&#8217;s heroine, Esther Summerson, and as an omniscient narrator. Memorable characters include the menacing lawyer Tulkinghorn, the friendly but depressive John Jarndyce and the childish Harold Skimpole. The plot concerns a long-running legal dispute (Jarndyce and Jarndyce) which has far-reaching consequences for all involved.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Second Epistle of Paul the Apostle to Timothy by American Standard Version\n\nThe Second Epistle to Timothy is one of the three Pastoral Epistles, written by Paul, and is part of the canonical New Testament. It may have been written sometime in 67 A.D. during Paul&#8217;s second Roman imprisonment. In his letter, the writer urges Timothy to not have a &#8220;spirit of timidity&#8221; and to &#8220;not be ashamed to testify about our Lord&#8221; (1:7-8). The writer also entreats Timothy to come to him before winter, and to bring Mark with him (cf. Philippians 2:22). He was anticipating that &#8220;the time of his departure was at hand&#8221; (4:6), and he exhorts his &#8220;son Timothy&#8221; to all diligence and steadfastness in the face of false teachings, with advice about combatting them with reference to the teachings of the past, and to patience under persecution (1:6&#8211;15), and to a faithful discharge of all the duties of his office (4:1&#8211;5), with all the solemnity of one who was about to appear before the Judge of the quick and the dead.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Dead Souls by Nikolai Vasilievich Gogol (Historical Fiction)\n\nDead Souls by Nikolai Gogol, Russian writer, was first published in 1842, and is one of the most prominent works of 19th-century Russian literature. Gogol himself saw it as an &#8220;epic poem in prose&#8221;, and within the book as a &#8220;novel in verse&#8221;. Despite supposedly completing the trilogy&#8217;s second part, Gogol destroyed it shortly before his death. Although the novel ends in mid-sentence (like Sterne&#8217;s Sentimental Journey), it is usually regarded as complete in the extant form.\n\nIn Russia before the emancipation of the serfs in 1861, landowners were entitled to own serfs to farm their land. Serfs were for most purposes considered the property of the landowner, and could be bought, sold, or mortgaged against, as any other chattel. To count serfs (and people in general), the measure word &#8220;soul&#8221; was used: e.g., &#8220;six souls of serfs&#8221;. The plot of the novel relies on &#8220;dead souls&#8221; (i.e., &#8220;dead serfs&#8221;) which are still accounted for in property registers. On another level, the title refers to the &#8220;dead souls&#8221; of Gogol&#8217;s characters, all of which visualise different aspects of poshlost (an untranslatable Russian word which is perhaps best rendered as &#8220;self-satisfied inferiority&#8221;, moral and spiritual, with overtones of middle-class pretentiousness, fake significance, and philistinism). \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Gettysburg Address by Abraham Lincoln (Essay/Short Non-Fiction, Philosophy, Politics)\n\nThe Dedication of the National Cemetery at Gettysburg, in November, 1863, followed a few short months after the roiling, acrid clouds of gun smoke dissipated, leaving a little crossroads town in Pennsylvania heir to the human tragedy of over 7,000 corpses and 21,000 men suffering wounds. It was a most unnatural disaster.\n\nOn November 19, the chief executive made the trip to the still-dazed, shot-torn community to deliver, almost as an afterthought (for he was not the keynote speaker), an address that clarified his belief that the Negro race should be liberated from its slavery, and that despite the loss of so much blood and life, the Union should hold to the goal of completing this emancipation.\n\nThat he knew the eyes of the nation would rest of him was evident; this address was the first speech since his inauguration that he prepared in advance. But these carefully crafted words &#8211; only 269 of them &#8211; became a vital part of our nation&#8217;s identity, and are a signature to the bedrock of our beliefs.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Eleven Theses on Feuerbach by Karl Marx. Translated into the public domain by Carl Manchester. (Philosophy, Politics) \n\nThe &#8220;Theses on Feuerbach&#8221; are eleven short philosophical notes written by Karl Marx in 1845. They outline a critique of the ideas of Marx&#8217;s fellow Young Hegelian philosopher Ludwig Feuerbach. The theses form a basis for the activism emphasised by Marx&#8217;s work, and this short text is perhaps best know for its ending &#8211; a Eureka for revolutionary socialism.\n\nThe theses were written in 1845, but not published until 1888 (five years after Marx&#8217;s death), with slight modifications by Friedrich Engels. The original text was published in 1924. This translation is based on the 1888 version. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Revelations of Divine Love by Julian of Norwich (Religion)\n\nJulian of Norwich (c. November 8, 1342 &#8211; c. 1416) is considered to be one of the greatest English mystics. Little is known of her life aside from her writings. Even her name is uncertain, the name &#8220;Julian&#8221; coming from the Church of St Julian in Norwich, where she occupied a cell adjoining the church as an anchoress.\n\nAt the age of thirty, suffering from a severe illness and believing she was on her deathbed, Julian had a series of intense visions. (They ended by the time she overcame her illness on May 13, 1373). These visions would twenty years later be the source of her major work, called Sixteen Revelations of Divine Love (circa 1393). This is believed to be the first book written by a woman in the English language. Julian became well known throughout England as a spiritual authority.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
