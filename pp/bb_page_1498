         "description" : "Moonfleet by John Meade Falkner (Children, Adventure)\n\nThe novel is set in a fishing village in Dorset during the mid 18th century. The story concerns a 15 year old orphan boy, John Trenchard, who becomes friends with an older man who turns out to be the leader of a gang of smugglers.\nOne night John chances on the smugglers&#8217; store in the crypt beneath the church. He explores but hides behind a coffin when he hears voices. He finds a locket which contains a parchment, in the coffin belonging to Colonel Mohune. Unfortunately after the visitors leave, he finds himself trapped inside, and is only rescued two days later when two of the smugglers, Ratsey, the sexton and Elzevir Block, the innkeeper of the Why Not?, the local pub, investigate his disappearance. His aunt insists he leaves her house and Elzevir Block takes him in to live at the pub. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Promised Land by Mary Antin (Biography)\n\nBeing a Jew in Russia at the end of the 19th century was not easy at all. Jews were persecuted because of their religion. So the Jews found comfort in their ancient traditions. When Mary Antin&#8217;s father decided that keeping to his traditions did not suit him anymore, he found no place in Russia. So he emigrated to America with his family. Life was not easy, though as a child, Mary describes life in Boston as almost perfect. A smart and dignified girl, Mary takes the good things in anything and writes her autobiography with a smile.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "An American Robinson Crusoe by Samuel B. Allison (Fiction, Adventure)\n\nAn American Robinson Crusoe is a short version of the original story. An indolent, rebellious teen goes on a marine voyage against his parents&#8217; wishes. The ship (and all of its crew) is lost in a storm, but Robinson makes it to a deserted island. He has no tools, no weapons, but he lives for over 28 years on the island. He befriends many animals on the island and after over 20 years living solo, he is joined by a young &#8220;savage&#8221; who becomes his constant companion. The transformation from the young, lazy teen to a self-sustaining, incredibly knowledgeable adult is one of the major themes in the story. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Renascence and Other Poems by Edna St. Vincent Millay\n\nThe following is a recording of the first volume of poetry published by Edna St. Vincent Millay. When the author had graduated from high school, she couldn&#8217;t afford to go to college. In the summer of 1912, Vincent&#8217;s sister, Norma, found work as a waitress at a hotel near where they lived. One night, Norma insisted that Vincent attend a masquerade ball, given at the hotel, if only to get Vincent out of the house and to meet people. Vincent finally gave in, and while there, sang songs and recited &#8220;Renascence,&#8221; the first poem in this collection. This immediately won over the support of one &#8220;Miss Dow,&#8221; who would help Vincent raise enough money to attend Vassar College. From there, she would meet others and become fully entrenched in, and later a major influence on, the literary community.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

It is not clear how much of the story material derives from the Baron himself; however, it is known that the majority of the stories are based on folktales that have been in circulation for many centuries before M&#252;nchhausen&apos;s birth. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Futility, Or the Wreck of the Titan by Morgan Robertson (Sea Stories, Tragedy)\n\nThis novel was published a full 14 years before the sinking of the Titanic, but listeners may be surprised at how many parallels this fictional tale has with subsequent true events.\n\nThe Titan is the largest and most technologically advanced steamship of her time. She is considered unsinkable. Her full speed crossings of the Northern Lane Route carry her rich passengers in the highest standards of luxury and comfort. The less well-off travel in rougher quarters but still benefit from the speed of travel. These crossings, however, are fraught with navigational hazards, the greatest of which is ice.\n\nUnlike the ship, one member of her crew is not of the highest standard. At least, not anymore. John Rowland is a broken man who drinks to forget his past. However, when the Titan crashes into an iceberg during her attempt to break a speed record, he is forced to confront his past. Can he overcome his enemies and escape as the ship begins to sink? And can he make his way back to civilization and find self-respect once more? Adventure and soul-searching await Rowland, with a surprise ending.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Neither does Disko Troop, skipper of the &#8220;We&#8217;re Here&#8221;, a fishing schooner out of Gloucester, Massachusetts, when his crew fishes Harvey Cheyne out of the Atlantic. There&#8217;s no place on the Grand Banks for bystanders, so Harvey is press-ganged into service as a replacement for a man lost overboard and drowned. Harvey is heir to a vast fortune, but his rescuers believe none of what he tells them of his background. Disko won&#8217;t take the boat to port until it is full of fish, so Harvey must settle in for a season at sea. Hard, dangerous work and performing it alongside a grab-bag of characters in close quarters is a life-changing experience.\n\nAnd when Harvey at last is reunited with his parents, who have thought him dead for months, he must face the hard decisions of how he will allow his experience to change his life. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

It is connected by name to his earlier and more famous epic poem Paradise Lost, with which it shares similar theological themes. Based on the Gospel of Luke&#8217;s version of the Temptation of Christ, Paradise Regained is more thoughtful in writing style, and thrives upon the imagery of Jesus&#8217; perfection in contrast to the shame of Satan.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "An American Politician by Francis Marion Crawford (Fiction)\n\nIn 1880&#8217;s Boston, Mass. the good life is lead according to all the Victorian era societal rules of the New World. Political ambitions and the business of making money go hand in hand. A Senate seat suddenly opens up due to the current junior senator&#8217;s unexpected death, and the political machinations to fill the seat begin. Senatorial candidate John Harrington is a young idealist who thinks that fighting for truth and justice, regardless of political affiliation, is the way. But he is told he can&#8217;t possibly win because he isn&#8217;t partisan enough. His opponents in the iron mine, railroad and shipping business sabotage his first bid for office, because he wants to do away with protectionism in trade to open up global competition. He eventually succeeds in winning a Senate seat. He gives a rousing speech to Congress as they gather to elect a President in a race which has ended in a three way tie. His message is that blindly following a party&#8217;s positions and principles is not being free and independent, and will not always lead to the best person being elected, or to the best decisions being made for the country as a whole. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Hosea (ASV) by American Standard Version (Religion)\n\nHosea was the son of Beeri and a prophet in Israel in the 8th century BCE. He is one of the Twelve Prophets of the Jewish Hebrew Bible, also known as the Minor Prophets of the Christian Old Testament. We know practically nothing about the life or social status of Hosea. According to the Book of Hosea, he married the prostitute Gomer, the daughter of Diblatayim, at God&#8217;s command. He lived in the Northern Kingdom in the period 740&#8211;725 BCE. In Hosea 5:8 ff., there is a reference to the wars which led to the capture of the kingdom by the Assyrians (ca. 734&#8211;732 BCE). It is not certain if he has also experienced the destruction of Samaria, which is foreseen in Hosea 14:1. Hosea&#8217;s family life reflected the &#8220;adulterous&#8221; relationship which Israel had built with polytheistic gods. His children&#8217;s names made them like walking prophecies of the fall of the ruling dynasty and the severed covenant with God &#8212; much like the prophet Isaiah a generation later. Hosea is often seen as a &#8220;prophet of doom&#8221;, but underneath his message of destruction is a promise of restoration.&#8221; \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Neilson (Fiction, Literature)\n\nSir Gawain and the Green Knight is a late 14th Century Middle English alliterative romance outlining an adventure of Sir Gawain, a knight of King Arthur&#8217;s Round Table. In the tale, Sir Gawain accepts a challenge from a mysterious warrior who is completely green, from his clothes and hair to his beard and skin. The &#8220;Green Knight&#8221; offers to allow anyone to strike him with his axe if the challenger will take a return blow in a year and a day. Gawain accepts, and beheads him in one blow, only to have the Green Knight stand up, pick up his head, and remind Gawain to meet him at the appointed time. The story of Gawain&#8217;s struggle to meet the appointment and his adventures along the way demonstrate the spirit of chivalry and loyalty.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Book of Obadiah from the American Standard Version (Religion)\n\n&#8220;The Book of Obadiah is found in both the Hebrew Bible and the Old Testament of the Christian Bible, where it is the\nshortest book, only one chapter long. Its authorship is generally attributed to a person named Obadiah, which means &#8220;servant (or worshipper) of the Lord&#8221;. Obadiah is classified as a &#8220;minor prophet&#8221; in the Christian Bible due to the brevity of the writing (only 21 verses) and the content (prophetic material). An Old Testament prophet was (professedly) not only a person who was given divine insight into future events, but a person whom the Lord used to declare his word. The first nine verses in the book foretell total destruction in the land of Edom at the hand of the Lord. Obadiah writes that this destruction will be so complete that it will be even worse than a thief who comes at night, for not even a thief would destroy everything. The Lord will allow all allies of Edom to turn away and help chase Edom out of its land. What is the reason for such a harsh punishment? Verses ten through fourteen explain that when Israel (the Lord&#8217;s chosen people) was attacked, Edom refused to help them, thus acting like an enemy. What is even worse is that Edom and Israel share a common blood line through their founders who were brothers, Jacob and Esau. Because of this gross neglect of a relative, Edom will be covered with shame and destroyed forever. The final verses, fifteen through twenty-one, depict the restoration of Israel and the wiping out of the Edomites. Verse eighteen says that there will be no survivors from the house of Esau once the destruction is complete. Israel will become a holy place and its people will return from exile and inhabit the land once inhabited by the Edomites.

However, the souls of the adversaries are still open to the light of Jesus: the light which transfigures through the miracle of His Icon: who is the Reaper, Who blesses the harvesting of good grains in the souls and uproots the tares of evil from there: this is what the master of the Bulgarian literature, Yordan Yovkov, relates with words of golden wheat and azure skies, taking the reader beyond the passions and mundane dust, through the suffering of the awaken conscience to the final victory of truth and good.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

The work was originally written in Hebrew, and the Book(s) of Samuel originally formed a single text, as they are often considered today in Hebrew bibles. Together with what is now referred to as the Book(s) of Kings, the translators who created the Greek Septuagint divided the text into four books, which they named the Books of the Kingdoms. In the Latin Vulgate version, these then became the Books of the Kings, thus 1 and 2 Samuel were referred to as 1 and 2 Kings, with 3 and 4 Kings being what are called 1 and 2 Kings by the King James Bible and its successors.&#8221;\n\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Persuasion by Jane Austen \n\n&#8220;All the privilege I claim for my own sex &#8230; is that of loving longest, when existence or when hope is gone.&#8221; In persuasion, her last novel, Austen explores the theme of postponed but enduring love, delayed by class boundaries and excessive pride. Anne Elliot, the story&#8217;s aged (27 year old) heroine, suffers from a decision that was forced upon her several years ago&#8212;to break off a relationship with Capn. Frederick Wentworth, the man she deeply loved. As Austen examines the causes and consequences of this action, she sketches for us the social complexities of being part of the upper-middle-class in England at the beginning of the nineteenth century.\n\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
