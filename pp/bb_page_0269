         "description" : "Travels in West Africa by Mary H. Kingsley (Travel, Adventure)\n\nMary Henrietta Kingsley (13 October 1862 &#8211; 3 June 1900) was an British explorer and writer who greatly influenced European ideas about Africa and its people. Kingsley was an outspoken critic of European colonialism, a champion for indigenous customs, and a dedicated campaigner for a revised British policy which supported traders and merchants over the needs of settlers and missionaries.\n\nHer adventures were extraordinary and fascinating. Among other things she fought with crocodiles, fell into native spear traps and was caught in a tornado on the slopes of Mount Cameroon. She traveled in West Africa wearing the same clothes she always wore in England: long, black, trailing skirts, tight waists, high collars and a small fur cap. These same clothes saved her life when she fell into a game pit, the many petticoats protecting her from being impaled on the stakes below.\n\nThis is her story in her own words of her adventures and the people and culture of West Africa.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Like the three synoptic gospels, it contains an account of some of the actions and sayings of Jesus, but differs from them in ethos and theological emphases. The purpose is expressed in the conclusion, 20:30-31: &#8220;&#8230;these (Miracles of Jesus) are written that you may (come to) believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that through this belief you may have life in his name. The book hinges on the seven signs Jesus performed and ends with the Passion of the Lord.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Much Ado About Nothing by William Shakespeare (Comedy)\n\nWritten around the middle of his career, Much Ado About Nothing is one of Shakespeare&apos;s great festive comedies. The men are back from the war, and everyone is ready for romance. The dashing young Claudio falls for Hero, the daughter of Leonato, governor of Messina, and his friend Don Pedro helps him secure her affection. These youthful lovers are contrasted with the more experienced (and more cynical) Benedick and Beatrice, who have to be tricked into falling in love. Don Pedro&apos;s bastard brother, Don John, provides the intrigue, and the dimwitted constable Dogberry provides the laughs.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Sense and Sensibility v2 by Jane Austen (Historical Fiction)\n\nThis is a story of the English moneyed class and its eternal struggle for creating &#8220;sense and sensibility&#8221; in its world. A potential marriage prospect must make &#8220;sense&#8221; by bringing with it enough assets and income to permit the couple to continue to live in happy, idle leisure, complete with servants and a prestigious address. Provided one can find such a match among the eligible persons of the opposite sex, one then hopes for &#8220;sensibility&#8221;, or capacity for emotion, so that if love is not immediately to hand, it might come around later. And while these gentlemen and ladies make their hopeful pirouettes in the social eye, they must of course adhere to all the forms of civility.\n\nJane Austen writes of the family of a gentleman named Dashwood who dies and leaves most of his fortune to his son, with the understanding that he will &#8220;look out for&#8221; his mother and three sisters. When that son marries a grasping woman who convinces him that his sisters&#8217; funds are suitable to their needs and so require no contributions from his inherited fortune, the sisters are left to play the game of &#8220;Sense and Sensibility&#8221; in earnest.\n\nBut all&#8217;s not fair in love. Carefully prepared &#8220;attachments&#8221; can and do go awry when gentlemen find other young women of greater fortunes than the Dashwood sisters. So, will they marry for love? Or money? Or perhaps, not at all? \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Beasts of Tarzan by Edgar Rice Burroughs (Adventure, Animals)\n\nThis is the third of Burrough&#8217;s Tarzan novels. Originally serialized in All-Story Cavalier magazine in 1914, the novel was first published in book form by A. C. McClurg in 1916.\n\nIn the previous novel Tarzan reclaimed his name and title as John Clayton, Lord Greystoke. In this novel he finds that proper society is just as vicious as the jungle when greedy men threaten him and his new family. Jane and her infant son Jack are kidnapped by Tarzan&#8217;s enemies, Nikolas Rokoff and Alexis Paulvitch, who then trap Tarzan himself and attempt to exile him forever on a primitive island, bereft of all those dear to him. There, however, Tarzan gains new allies in the panther Sheeta and the ape Akut, together with Akut&#8217;s band. With their aid he tracks down his wife and son. . .and his arch enemies Rokoff and Paulvitch.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "On the Duty of Civil Disobedience by Henry David Thoreau (Philosophy)\n\nCivil Disobedience is an essay by Henry David Thoreau. Published in 1849 under the title Resistance to Civil Government, it expressed Thoreau&#8217;s belief that people should not allow governments to overrule or atrophy their consciences, and that people have a duty both to avoid doing injustice directly and to avoid allowing their acquiescence to enable the government to make them the agents of injustice. Thoreau was motivated in part by his disgust with slavery and the Mexican-American War. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

While the latter plot is a fairytale with many nonsense elements and poems, similar to Carroll&#8217;s Alice books, the story set in Victorian Britain is a social novel, with its characters discussing various concepts and aspects of religion, society, philosophy and morality.\n\nThis book is the first of two volumes and the two intertwining stories are brought to a close in the second volume, Sylvie and Bruno Concluded.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Dr. Weymouth was a Bible scholar and a philologist (a student of the origins of language), as well as a layman, in the English Baptist denomination. He edited &#8220;The Resultant Greek Text&#8221;, after which he based his &#8220;New Testament in Modern Speech&#8221;, which was published posthumously in 1903. He passed away on December 27, 1902 in Essex. His work is known for its simpler language and use in private reading. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
