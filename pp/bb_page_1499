         "description" : "Poems of William Blake by William Blake\n\nSongs of Innocence and of Experience: Shewing the Two Contrary States of the Human Soul are two books of poetry by the English poet and painter, William Blake. Although Songs of Innocence was first published by itself in 1789, it is believed that Songs of Experience has always been published in conjunction with Innocence since its completion in 1794.\n\nSongs of Innocence mainly consists of poems describing the innocence and joy of the natural world, advocating free love and a closer relationship with God, and most famously including Blake&#226;&#128;&#153;s poem The Lamb. Its poems have a generally light, upbeat and pastoral feel and are typically written from the perspective of children or written about them.\n\nDirectly contrasting this, Songs of Experience instead deals with the loss of innocence after exposure to the material world and all of its mortal sin during adult life, including works such as The Tyger. Poems here are darker, concentrating on more political and serious themes. Throughout both books, many poems fall into pairs, so that a similar situation or theme can be seen in both Innocence and Experience. Many of the poems appearing in Songs of Innocence have a counterpart in Songs of Experience with opposing perspectives of the world. The disastrous end of the French Revolution caused Blake to lose faith in the goodness of mankind, explaining much of the volume&#226;&#128;&#153;s sense of despair. Blake also believed that children lost their innocence through exploitation and from a religious community which put dogma before mercy. He did not, however, believe that children should be kept from becoming experienced entirely. In truth, he believed that children should indeed become experienced but through their own discoveries, which is reflected in a number of these poems. Blake believed that innocence and experience were &#226;&#128;&#156;the two contrary states of the human soul&#226;&#128;&#157;, and that true innocence was impossible without experience.\n\nThe Book of Thel is a poem by William Blake, dated 1789 and probably worked on in the period 1788 to 1790. It is illustrated by his own plates, and is relatively short and easy to understand, compared to his later prophetic books. The metre is a fourteen-syllable line. It was preceded by Tiriel, which Blake left in manuscript. A few lines from Tiriel were incorporated into The Book of Thel. This book consists of eight plates executed in illuminated printing. 15 copies of original print of 1789-1793 are known. Two copies have watermark of 1815, which are more elaborately colored than the others.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Point of Honor by Joseph Conrad\n\t\t\nSet during the Napoleonic Wars, &#8220;The Point of Honor&#8221; (English title: &#8220;The Duel&#8221;) features two French Hussar officers, D&#8217;Hubert and Feraud. Their quarrel over an initially minor incident turns into a bitter, long-drawn out struggle over the following fifteen years, interwoven with the larger conflict that provides its backdrop. At the beginning, Feraud is the one who jealously guards his honor and repeatedly demands satisfaction anew when a duelling encounter ends inconclusively; he aggressively pursues every opportunity to locate and duel his foe. As the story progresses, D&#8217;Hubert also finds himself caught up in the contest, unable to back down or walk away.\n\nThis Conrad short story evidently has its genesis in the real duels that two French Hussar officers fought in the Napoleonic era. Their names were Dupont and Fournier, which Conrad disguised slightly, changing Dupont into D&#8217;Hubert and Fournier into Feraud. In 1977, it was turned into a movie, &#8220;The Duellists&#8221;, starring Keith Carradine and Harvey Keitel.\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Book of Nahum from the American Standard Version\n\t\t\nNahum prophesied, according to some, in the beginning of the reign of Ahaz (740s BC). Others, however, think that his prophecies are to be referred to the latter half of the reign of Hezekiah (700s BC). Probably the book was written in Jerusalem, where he witnessed the invasion of Sennacherib and the destruction of his host (2 Kings 19:35). And still others support the idea that the &#8220;book of vision&#8221; was written shortly before the fall of Nineveh (612 BCE). This theory is evidenced by the fact that the oracles must be dated after the Assyrian destruction of Thebes in 663 BCE as this event is mentioned in Nah 3:8.\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The Book of Habakkuk from the American Standard Version\n\t\t\nPractically nothing is known about Habakkuk&#8217;s personal history, except for what can be inferred from the text of his book, which consists of five oracles about the Chaldeans (Babylonians) and a song of praise to God. Since the Chaldean rise to power is dated c. 612 BC, it is assumed he was active about that time, making him an early contemporary of Jeremiah and Zephaniah. Jewish sources, however, do not group him with those two prophets, who are often placed together, so it is possible that he was slightly earlier than they. Because the final chapter of his book is a song, it is sometimes assumed in Jewish tradition that he was a member of the tribe of Levi, which served as musicians in Solomon&#8217;s Temple. According to the Zohar (Volume 1, page 8b) Habakkuk is the boy born to the Shunamite woman through Elisha&#8217;s blessing. Habakkuk is unique among the prophets in that he openly questions the wisdom of God.(citation needed) In the first part of the first chapter, the Prophet sees the injustice among his people and asks why God does not take action: &#8220;1:2 Yahweh, how long will I cry, and you will not hear? I cry out to you &#8216;Violence!&#8217; and will you not save?&#8221;\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Book of Zephaniah by American Standard Version\n\t\t\nThe superscription of the Book of Zephaniah attributes its authorship to &#8220;Zephaniah son of Cushi son of Gedaliah son of Amariah son of Hezekiah, in the days of King Josiah son of Amon of Judah&#8221; (1:1, NRSV). All that is known of Zephaniah comes from the text. The superscription of the book is lengthier than most and contains two features. The name Cushi, Zephaniah&#8217;s father, means &#8216;Ethiopian&#8217;. In a society where genealogy was considered extremely important because of God&#8217;s covenant with Abraham and his descendants, the author may have felt compelled to establish his Hebrew lineage. In fact, this lineage is traced back to Hezekiah, who was king of Judah. The author of Zephaniah does not shrink from condemning the Cushites or Ethiopians. Chapter 2:12 contains a succinct but unequivocal message: &#8220;You also, O Ethiopians, / Shall be killed by my sword.&#8221; Zephaniah&#8217;s familial connection with King Hezekiah may have also legitimized his harsh indictment of the royal city in 3:1-7.\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "The First Book of Urizen by William Blake\n\t\t\nThe Book of Urizen is one of the major prophetic books of the English poet William Blake, illustrated by Blake&#8217;s own plates. It was originally published as The First Book of Urizen in 1794. Later editions dropped the word &#8220;first&#8221;.\n\nThe book takes its name from the character Urizen in Blake&#8217;s mythology, who represents alienated reason as the source of oppression. The book describes Urizen as the &#8220;primeaval priest&#8221;, and describes how he became separated from the other Eternals to create his own alienated and enslaving realm of religious dogma. Los and Enitharmon create a space within Urizen&#8217;s fallen universe to give birth to their son Orc, the spirit of revolution and freedom.\n\nIn form, the book is a parody of the Book of Genesis, with Blake&#8217;s Urizen being more similar to the demiurge of the Gnostics than a benevolent creator.\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

         "description" : "Twentieth Century New Testament by Twentieth Century New Testament\n\t\t\nPublished in 1904, The Twentieth Century New Testament is considered the first translation of the Bible into modern English. It was produced in Britain over a period of 15 years by approximately 20 people -- ministers, housewives, school teachers and businessmen -- who were united by their desire for a New Testament in the language of the people. They were advised by such scholars as J. Rendel Harris and Richard Weymouth so their rendering is quite accurate. In addition they made some effort at rearranging the New Testament books in the order scholars believe they were written -- Mark comes before Matthew, for instance. They also include brief introductions before each book. Though little-known today, the reader will find in The Twentieth Century New Testament a delightful translation that is rewarding both for in-depth study and personal reading.\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

With a dry wit, he exposed the human failings of his subjects and what he saw as the hypocrisy at the centre of Victorian morality.
