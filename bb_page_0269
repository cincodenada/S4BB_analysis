{"ldata":[{"name":"z Travels in West Africa Audiobook","id":123682,"description":"Travels in West Africa by Mary H. Kingsley (Travel, Adventure)\n\nMary Henrietta Kingsley (13 October 1862 &#8211; 3 June 1900) was an British explorer and writer who greatly influenced European ideas about Africa and its people. Kingsley was an outspoken critic of European colonialism, a champion for indigenous customs, and a dedicated campaigner for a revised British policy which supported traders and merchants over the needs of settlers and missionaries.\n\nHer adventures were extraordinary and fascinating. Among other things she fought with crocodiles, fell into native spear traps and was caught in a tornado on the slopes of Mount Cameroon. She traveled in West Africa wearing the same clothes she always wore in England: long, black, trailing skirts, tight waists, high collars and a small fur cap. These same clothes saved her life when she fell into a game pit, the many petticoats protecting her from being impaled on the stakes below.\n\nThis is her story in her own words of her adventures and the people and culture of West Africa.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

A potential marriage prospect must make &#8220;sense&#8221; by bringing with it enough assets and income to permit the couple to continue to live in happy, idle leisure, complete with servants and a prestigious address. Provided one can find such a match among the eligible persons of the opposite sex, one then hopes for &#8220;sensibility&#8221;, or capacity for emotion, so that if love is not immediately to hand, it might come around later. And while these gentlemen and ladies make their hopeful pirouettes in the social eye, they must of course adhere to all the forms of civility.\n\nJane Austen writes of the family of a gentleman named Dashwood who dies and leaves most of his fortune to his son, with the understanding that he will &#8220;look out for&#8221; his mother and three sisters. When that son marries a grasping woman who convinces him that his sisters&#8217; funds are suitable to their needs and so require no contributions from his inherited fortune, the sisters are left to play the game of &#8220;Sense and Sensibility&#8221; in earnest.\n\nBut all&#8217;s not fair in love. Carefully prepared &#8220;attachments&#8221; can and do go awry when gentlemen find other young women of greater fortunes than the Dashwood sisters. So, will they marry for love? Or money? Or perhaps, not at all? \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Published in 1849 under the title Resistance to Civil Government, it expressed Thoreau&#8217;s belief that people should not allow governments to overrule or atrophy their consciences, and that people have a duty both to avoid doing injustice directly and to avoid allowing their acquiescence to enable the government to make them the agents of injustice. Thoreau was motivated in part by his disgust with slavery and the Mexican-American War. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
