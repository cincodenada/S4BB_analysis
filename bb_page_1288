{"ldata":[{"name":"z The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus Audiobook","id":99530,"description":"The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus by L. Frank Baum (Fantasy, Children)\n\nThis story of Santa Claus veers away slightly from the traditional stories of his beginnings. L. Frank Baum creates a world of fantasy that surrounds Santa Claus&#8217;s life. Orphaned at an infant he is found by the nymph Necile, who convinces the great Ak to allow her to raise Claus for her own. As he grows older he meets his fellow humans, and sees the neglect of children. This sets him on the path to making toys and becoming the beloved Saint Nicholas we are familiar with today. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Although the primary focus of this short novel is the selfish behavior of Lady Susan as she engages in affairs and searches for suitable husbands for herself and her young daughter, the actual action shares its importance with Austen&#8217;s manipulation of her characters&#8217; behavior by means of their reactions to the letters that they receive. The heroine adds additional interest by altering the tone of her own letters based on the recipient of the letter. Thus, the character of Lady Susan is developed through many branches as Austen suggests complications of identity and the way in which that identity is based on interaction rather than on solitary constructions of personality.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

He wrote critical texts on religion, morality, contemporary culture, philosophy and science, using a distinctive German language style and displaying a fondness for aphorism. Nietzsche&#8217;s influence remains substantial within and beyond philosophy, notably in existentialism and postmodernism.\n\nThus Spake Zarathustra is a work composed in four parts between 1883 and 1885. Much of the work deals with ideas such as the &#8220;eternal recurrence of the same&#8221;, the parable on the &#8220;death of God&#8221;, and the &#8220;prophecy&#8221; of the Overman, which were first introduced in The Gay Science. Described by Nietzsche himself as &#8220;the deepest ever written&#8221;, the book is a dense and esoteric treatise on philosophy and morality, featuring as protagonist a fictionalized Zarathustra. A central irony of the text is that the style of the Bible is used by Nietzsche to present ideas of his which fundamentally oppose Judaeo-Christian morality and tradition.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

The narrative chronicles the trials of Job as he is brought low from a comfortable and exalted position in his community to face loss of his fortune, children and health. Joined by three friends who initially commiserate and sympathize with him, there ensues a lengthy argument about the fate of the wicked and the just and much questioning about the character of God and the justice He metes out to his creations.\n\nA quite lively and poetic discussion ensues among these wise elders and their suppositions and conclusions are eventually contested by a youth who enters the discussion toward the end. God has the final word in this narrative and Job is left to abjectly acknowledge that his complaints and knowledge mean little in the face of that which is so far beyond his ability to comprehend.\n\nDebate regarding the meaning, purpose and author of this book is still hotly contested among biblical scholars. It is far beyond the scope of this summary to offer any conclusions regarding this work. The reader offers the words to the listener with no judgment or further explanation.\n\nEven without deep examination, the poetic nature of the story offers many insights into facing and overcoming adversity.","shortDescription":"Bible (ASV) 18: Job by American Standard Version","parentName":null,"discriminator":1,"categories":[{"name":"Religion","parent":null,"id":68,"productTypeId":null,"nrOfResults":0}],"packageId":"gYABgD69SfSR4NcQNrhLfTlhCjs","rating":-1,"ratingIntValue":-1,"minimumos":null,"vendorId":102,"iconId":643352,"parentId":null,"vendorName":"S4BB Limited","contentAvailableAfterFiltering":null,"vendorHomeUrl":"http://www.s4bb.com","vendorSupportEmail":null,"vendorPrivacyPolicyURL":null,"screenShots":null,"_itemDetailsLink":"/content/99581","nrOfReviews":0,"featuredDescription":"Bible (ASV) 18: Job by American Standard Version","featuredIconId":643353,"nrOfApprovedReviews":0,"rowNumber":null,"nameLength":31,"shortDescriptionLength":48,"orderColumn":null,"licenses":[{"initialRenewalPeriod":null,"licenseType":2,"price":4.99,"licenseModelType":1,"pricingtierId":4,"renewalPricintTierId":null,"renewalPrice":null,"accessDuration":null,"priceString":"$4.99","renewalPriceString":null,"purchaseAmountOfUnits":null,"purchaseUnitType":null}],"cdDTO":null,"iconImgUrl":"http://download.appworld.blackberry.com/ClientAPI/image/643352","featuredIconImageUrl":"http://download.appworld.blackberry.com/ClientAPI/image/643353","packageNameList":["audiobook0421e25b8c90285979cee8124f52468d2298"],"grandParentId":null,"grandParentName":null,"contentRatingLevel":1,"supportedCarriers":null,"supportedCountries":null},{"name":"z Bible (WEB) 32: Jonah Audiobook","id":99582,"description":"Bible (WEB) 32: Jonah by World English Bible\n\nThis short narrative book of the Old Testament contains one of the most famous Bible Stories, of &#8220;Jonah and the Whale.&#8221; The &#8220;great fish&#8221; however is only mentioned in three verses, and the true punch comes in the oft-neglected fourth chapter. &#8220;Is it right&#8221; for a person like Jonah to be vexed by God&#8217;s mercy on others?\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
