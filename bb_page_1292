It was issued by Treves on October 17, 1886, the first day of school in Italy, and rose to immediate success.\n\nThe novel is written in a diary form as told by Enrico Bottini, a 10-year old primary school student in Italy with an upper class background who is surrounded by classmates of working class origin. The entire chronological setting corresponds to the third-grade season.\n\nEnrico&#8217;s parents and older siblings sometimes correspond with Enrico through the means of his diary: his teacher assigns him with homework dealing with stories of children throughout the Italian states, who should serve as role models &#8211; the stories are then given in full as Enrico is supposed to have written them.

The plot centers around the men and women of the town, some of whom are beaten down by the city&#8217;s utilitarian ideals and some of whom manage to rise above it. The novel was written in 1854 and was a scathing attack on then-current ideas of utilitarianism, which Dickens viewed as a selfish and at times oppressive philosophy. Perhaps the novel&#8217;s best features are its clever, ironic narration and the larger-than-life characters that push the plot forward, such as the upper-class banker and hypocritical braggart, Josiah Bounderby, and the fact-driven schoolmaster, Thomas Gradgrind.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
