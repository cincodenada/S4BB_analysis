The very first canto serves as an introduction to the poem and is generally not considered to be part of the first cantica, bringing the total number of cantos to 100.\nThe poet tells in the first person his travel through the three realms of the dead, lasting during the Easter Triduum in the spring of 1300.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
