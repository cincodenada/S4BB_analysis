{"ldata":[{"name":"z What Men Live By and Other Tales Audiobook","id":99587,"description":"What Men Live By and Other Tales by Leo Tolstoy (Short stories)\n\nAlthough Leo Tolstoy (1828-1910) was a wealthy landowner, in his later life he had what was considered a &#8220;religious awakening.&#8221; This experience went on to inform his writing and his lifestyle in profound ways. His views transcended the specifics of religion, as known in his day &#8211; so much so he came to be a helpful guide both to Mohandas Gandhi and to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The four stories in this collection ask profound questions and gently supply helpful, non-dogmatic hints to their answerings: What is the most important thing to do? Who is the most important person? When is the most important time? What is worth owning? What is the most profound religion? What rules should men live by? How much land does a man need? Who is God? What should we bother to discuss? How should we act towards one another? How should we respond to cruelty and violence? And many more. Wonderful stories written in a relaxed style.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Burgess (Children)\n\nDeep in the heart of every parent is the wish, the desire, to have other adults tell us, in an unsolicited way, just how very polite one&#8217;s child is! This perhaps was even more the case in 1903, when Gelett Burgess produced his second book on the Goops. With entertaining cartoons &#8211; cariacatures of misbehaving children &#8211; he described many different breaches of tact and good manners.\n\nBurgess wrote several books of poetry on the Goops, each poem describing some significant way in which an unthoughtful or unkind child could offend polite society and often offering the hope that the listener would never behave that way. Ahem! Well, perhaps very few people have succeeded in not acting Goop-like at some point in their lives, but read along with Burgess as he attempts to define, in a humorous fashion, exactly what the differences between &#8220;Good&#8221; and &#8220;Goop&#8221; are!\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Published in 1854, it details Thoreau&#8217;s life for two years, two months, and two days around the shores of Walden Pond. Walden is neither a novel nor a true autobiography, but a social critique of the Western World, with each chapter heralding some aspect of humanity that needed to be either renounced or praised. Along with his critique of the civilized world, Thoreau examines other issues afflicting man in society, ranging from economy and reading to solitude and higher laws. He also takes time to talk about the experience at Walden Pond itself, commenting on the animals and the way people treated him for living there, using those experiences to bring out his philosophical positions. This extended commentary on nature has often been interpreted as a strong statement to the natural religion that transcendentalists like Thoreau and Emerson were preaching.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Unlike that book, this collection leaves the battlefield itself behind to explore the damage war does to people&#8217;s hearts and minds. Reeking of dashed hopes, simultaneously sympathetic with the victims of war and cynical about the purposes of war, Crane implicitly criticizes the image of the romantic hero and asks if Love can survive.\n\nThe poetic voice is one of an old and wearied soul, stark and disillusioned, which is all the more intriguing since Crane was dead before he reached his 30th birthday. His work calls to mind the Beat Poets of the mid 20th century in its powerful use of language and bleak idiomatic landscape. It is poetry on the cusp of the fin de si&#232;cle; echoing the passing age and presaging the newborn century.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
