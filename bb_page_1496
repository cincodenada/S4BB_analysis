The Peterkins are a lovable but comically inept family with ingenuity, logic, resourcefulness, and energy&#8212;but not common sense. Many chapters show the family trying to solve some problem in a roundabout way, failing, and eventually being rescued by &#8220;the wise old lady from Philadelphia,&#8221; who cuts the Gordian knot with an effective but prosaic solution. The charm of the story is not in the plot, but in the telling, building up layers of complication, and the affectionate fun poked at the not-quite-cartoonish characters.

Considered outlaws, the colonists are in permanent hiding.\n\n\nThey have developed friendship and cooperation with a local race of &#8220;mermen&#8221; who are equally at home on land or sea. But that race only took to the sea to escape a malevolent power that hunted them and killed them violently for sport &#8211; Those Others.\n\n\nWith a global decline in the population and reach of Those Others, contacts are few and the humans have no direct knowlege of them. So it is a major surprise when Dalgard, a human scout on his coming-of-age expedition, along with his &#8220;knife-brother&#8221; Sssuri of the mermen, run into a party of Those Others who are bent on reclaiming hideous weaponries left behind in one of their abandoned cities&#8230; and find that they are being aided by new arrivals from Earth!\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Faust was born in Seattle, Washington and at an early age moved with his parents to the San Joaquin Valley in California where he worked as a ranchhand. After a failed attempt to enlist in the Great War in 1917 and with the help of Mark Twain&#8217;s sister he met Robert Hobart Davis, editor of All-Story Weekly and became a regular contributor writting under his most used pseudonym &#8220;Max Brand&#8221;. He wrote in many genres during his career and produced more than 300 western novels and stories. His most famous characters were Destry and Dr. Kildare, both of which were produced in film. Faust was killed in Italy in 1944 as a front line war correspondent at the age of 51. He is buried in the Sicily-Rome American Cemetery in Nettuno, Italy.\n\nRonicky Doone (1921) is a hero of the west, respected by the law-abiding citizen and hated by bushwhacking bandits. Bill Gregg is a man in love, not about to be deflected from meeting his lady love for the first time, and willing to stand up to the living legend to reach her. This initial meeting leads to a friendship between the two and they travel east to New York City on the trail of the girl. When they find the girl, Caroline Smith, and she refuses to leave, Ronicky must discover the secret that holds her. They encounter the sinister John Mark and the beautiful Ruth Tolliver and are exposed to the horrors and vices of big city life as they attempt to rescue Caroline and find their way back to the mountain-desert of the west. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
