The title page of the first edition states that it was &#8220;Translated from the Original Equine by Anna Sewell.&#8221; It was composed in the last years of her life, during which she was confined to her house as an invalid. After its publication in 1877, Sewell lived just long enough to see her first and only novel become an immediate bestseller, as well as it encouraging the better treatment of many cruelly-treated animals.\n\nAlthough initially intended for people who work with horses, it soon became a children&#8217;s classic. While outwardly teaching animal welfare, it also contains allegorical lessons about how to treat people with kindness, sympathy and respect. The story is narrated in the first person and each short chapter relates an incident in Black Beauty&#8217;s life, with Sewell&#8217;s detailed observations and extensive descriptions of horse behaviour lending the novel a good deal of verisimilitude.\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Far more than mere tales to amuse children, they passed along the collective wisdom of the tribes. In the 1830s, government Indian Agent and ethnologist Henry R Schoolcraft learned the language of these people and went out to collect and preserve their stories before the tribes disappeared under the westward rush of American civilization.

His witty, biting and occasionally odd short stories satirised Edwardian culture. Saki is considered a master of the short story and has been compared to O.

The stories in this collection are a foil for allowing the jaded and insider/outsider figure of Reginald to comment on some ridiculous or provincial attitudes prevalent in upper class Edwardian society, although one can easily recognize these same attitudes in our society today. Long popular and well known, Saki&#8217;s brilliant humour is as enjoyable now as it was almost a century ago.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

It begins with an intriguing fortune offered to John Harmon by his late father, a rich dust contractor, in his will.\n\nTo receive the money, John must marry a certain Bella Wilfer who he does not know from Eve. He is returning from the exile enforced by his father and confides in a ship&#8217;s mate who attempts to murder him. The mate gets killed instead, leaving one inconvenient corpse. Because John is considered dead (the body is found with his papers), the money passes to Mr Boffin, old Harmon&#8217;s foreman. Harmon adopts Bella and John comes into his employ disguised as John Rokesmith. Bella does not fall for John but through kindly Boffin&#8217;s contrivances learns to hate money and fall for her suitor under his false name. Eventually she learns of his true identity as the Boffins had previously, and the villainous one-legged Silas Wegg&#8217;s plot to blackmail Mr Boffin is brought to light.\n\nThere is also a story running behind the main plot about a certain Eugene Wrayburn and his love for Lizzie Hexam, and his rival&#8217;s attempt to murder him. The two plots are only really connected through the waterside murders but it allows Dickens to indulge in an extremely socially diverse cast of characters.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
