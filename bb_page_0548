Marked by profound sentiments, gravity and melodious harmony, the poems are strewn on the fields of soulful love, rueful reminiscence and the immortal yearnings of a Christian soul, and represent a fragrant assemblage of noetic flowers from the glebes of olden England. For those not familiar with the Bronte sisters&#8217; poetry, it should be noted that many of their poems were written in the context of their fictional, shared worlds of Gondal and Angria.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

He believed that commercial civilizations rise and fall in predictable cycles. First, masses of people draw together in large population centers and engage in commercial activities. As their desire for wealth grows, they discard spiritual and creative values. Their greed leads to distrust and dishonesty, and eventually the society crumbles. In The Law of Civilisation and Decay (1895), Adams noted that as new population centers emerged in the west, centers of world trade shifted from Constantinople to Venice to Amsterdam to London. He predicted in America&#8217;s Economic Supremacy (1900) that New York would become the centre for world trade.\n\nThe Theory of Social Revolutions was written in 1913. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

But first, he has the small matter of a mutiny on board his starship, and people are trying to kill him!\n\nWritten in an era when radios used vacuum tubes, the scientific component of the story is quaint and dated.
