This is a tough, literary journey. It was tough for Twain and his fellow &#8220;pilgrims&#8221;, both religious and otherwise. They set out, on a June day in 1867, to visit major tourist sites in Europe and the near east, including Greece, Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, &#8220;the Holy Land&#8221;, and Egypt. What Twain records, in often humorous, sometimes grotesque but always fascinating detail, are the day-to-day ups and downs of discovering the truth about people and places. The truths they learn are often far different than their education and rumor have made them preconceive.\n\nThis is a voyage of discovery. It&#8217;s long and, in places, tiresome. But it&#8217;s revelatory about so much. As with some of his other works, Twain includes popular prejudices of his time, which are today considered socially unacceptable. His references to &#8220;Indians&#8221;, &#8220;Negroes&#8221; and &#8220;infidels&#8221; come to mind.\n\nBeyond the lows, though, there are the highs of Twain&#8217;s cutting wit and insight as he guides us along the bumpy and often dangerous voyage. No need to buckle up. Just take it slow, and steady&#8230;like the journey itself.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

G. Wells (Science Fiction)\n\nH. G. Wells wrote The War of the Worlds in 1898, when there was much speculation about life on the planet Mars. The book is considered to be one of the first science fiction novels. In the story, an English gentleman narrates the events of a violent and fast paced Martian invasion.\n\nThe frightening images of people fleeing from gigantic tripod machines and the prospect of life under Martian rule have served as a bottomless well of inspiration for popular culture. The novel has served as a template for many derivative or inspired works, including comics, countless books, a tv series, several films, a bestselling musical, and the famous Orson Wells broadcast. Overall, The War of the Worlds has become an early milestone in and inspiration for the invasion genre.\n\nThe novel demonstrates Wells&#8217; typical pessimistic outlook on human nature and offers a good deal of critisism on society and people&#8217;s ignorance and vanity. The War of the Worlds can be read as an indictment of European colonial actions around the globe at that time &#8211; with which the injustice of the Martian invasion can be compared. Wells has since been credited with predicting quite a number of technologies, such as laser-like rays, industrial robot-like machines, and chemical-warfare.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

His two series of novels, the political (The Pallisers) and the clerical (The Barsetshire Chronicles) are the best known. This book is the first of the Barsetshire series and was also Trollope&#8217;s first really successful novel.\n\nIn the mid nineteenth century there were a number of financial scandals in the Church of England including those of Rochester, where the endowments which should have supported the King&#8217;s School Canterbury had been diverted to the Dean and Chapter; and of the hospital of St Cross at Winchester where the Rev. Francis North, later the Earl of Guildford, had been appointed to the mastership of the hospital by his father the bishop. The revenues of the hospital were very considerable, the work involved minimal. The scandal soon broke.\n\nTrollope based &#8216;The Warden&#8217; on the St Cross case, but in the novel the Warden is a kindly, devoted, priest, beloved by all that knew him and is racked by fear that he is accepting money to which he is not entitled. His antagonist is his prospective son-in-law John Bold and his (somewhat unwelcome) ally is one of Trollope&#8217;s strongest characters, the Archdeacon of Barchester, Dr. Theophilus Grantly. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

As a matter of fact, I believe this volume will prove of unusual interest; some of the reviews are curiously prophetic; some are, of course, biassed by prejudice hostile or friendly; others are conceived in the author&#8217;s wittiest and happiest vein; only a few are colourless. And if, according to Lord Beaconsfield, the verdict of a continental nation may be regarded as that of posterity, Wilde is a much greater force in our literature than even friendly contemporaries ever supposed he would become.\n\nIt should be remembered, however, that at the time when most of these reviews were written Wilde had published scarcely any of the works by which his name has become famous in Europe, though the protagonist of the &#230;sthetic movement was a well-known figure in Paris and London.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

K. Chesterton (Mystery)\n\nThis is the second of five books of short stories about G. K. Chesterton&#8217;s fictional detective, first published in 1914. Father Brown is a short, nondescript Catholic Priest with shapeless clothes and a large umbrella who has an uncanny insight into human evil. His methods, unlike those of his near contemporary Sherlock Holmes, although based on observation of details often unnoticed by others, tended to be intuitive rather than deductive. Although clearly devout, he always emphasizes rationality: despite his religiousness and his belief in God and miracles, he manages to see the perfectly ordinary, natural explanation of the problem. He is a devout, educated and &#8220;civilized&#8221; clergyman, who is totally familiar with contemporary and secular thought and behavior. His character was thought to be based on Father John O&#8217;Connor (1870 &#8211; 1952), a parish priest in Bradford, Yorkshire. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

The novel is now remembered as a classic of English literature, though some critics claim that it has structural problems; Thackeray sometimes lost track of the huge scope of his work, mixing up characters&#8217; names and minor plot details. The number of allusions and references it contains can make it difficult for modern readers to follow. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

His poems directly and deeply influenced all the major poets of the age. He was known by his contemporaries as a meticulous craftsman who was more rigorous in his careful reworking of his poems than any other poet. As important as Coleridge was to poetry as a poet, he was equally important to poetry as a critic. Coleridge&apos;s philosophy of poetry, which he developed over many years, has been deeply influential in the field of literary criticism.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
