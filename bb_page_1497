{"ldata":[{"name":"z Der Golem Audiobook","id":125586,"description":"Der Golem by Gustav Meyrink (Fantasy)\n\n&#8220;Der Golem&#8221; von Gustav Meyrink gilt als ein Klassiker der phantastischen Literatur. Es handelt sich dabei nicht um eine Adaption der j&#252;dischen Golem &#8211; Sage, sondern um ein impressionistisches Traumbild vor dessen Hintergrund.\n\nDer Erz&#228;hler tr&#228;umt Ereignisse, die sich 30 Jahre zuvor im Prager Ghetto zugetragen haben. Er tr&#228;umt sich dabei in die Rolle des Athanasius Pernath, der um 1890/91 dort lebte.\n\nPernath erh&#228;lt von einem mysteri&#246;sen Auftraggeber ein Buch zur Reparatur. Bald hat er den Verdacht, es k&#246;nnte sich bei diesem Unbekannten um den Golem handeln, der 1580 von Rabbi L&#246;w erschaffen worden sein soll und nun alle 33 Jahre in Prag umgehe. Von nun an ger&#228;t Pernaths Leben durcheinander. Er wird von Halluzinationen geplagt, die er nicht versteht, und in Intrigen verwickelt, deren Mittelpunkt der Tr&#246;dler Aaron Wassertrum ist und die Pernath f&#252;r ein paar Monate ins Gef&#228;ngnis bringen. Der Archivar Hillel wird ihm Freund und Mentor und Pernath verliebt sich in dessen Tochter Mirjam. Auf der Spur des Golem findet er durch eine Fallt&#252;r den Weg in ein &#8220;Zimmer ohne Zugang&#8221; und erkennt es als die Behausung des Golems. Als er aus dem Gef&#228;ngnis entlassen wird, ist der Teil des Ghettos, in dem er bisher gewohnt hat, abgerissen und seine fr&#252;heren Freunde sind gestorben oder fortgezogen. Als er sich vom Dach eines brennenden Geb&#228;udes abseilt, st&#252;rzt er ab.\n\nHier erwacht der Erz&#228;hler aus seinem Traum und entdeckt bei Nachforschungen Spuren der getr&#228;umten Gestalten und seines &#8220;Traum Doppelg&#228;ngers&#8221; in der wirklichen Welt. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Dopp was well-known as a teacher and writer of children&#8217;s textbooks at the turn of the 20th Century. She was among the first educators to encourage the incorporation of physical and practical activity into the elementary school curriculum at a time when such activities were becoming less commonplace in a child&#8217;s home environment. The Tree-Dwellers &#8211; The Age of Fear is the first in a series of elementary school texts written by Ms. Dopp that focus on the anthropological development of early human groups. Each lesson begins by posing a few questions for the child to think about, then factual information about these early humans is presented in story form using language a 6-7 yr old child can easily read and understand, followed by suggested activities that will help the child to experience first-hand some of the points presented in the story.

Der Zyklus wurde zuerst 1800 in der Zeitschrift Athen&#228;um ver&#246;ffentlicht. Die Hymnen an die Nacht ist das einzige gr&#246;&#223;ere Werk, das zu Novalis&#8217; Lebzeiten ver&#246;ffentlicht und auch von ihm fertiggestellt wurde. Die Hymnen werden als H&#246;hepunkt seiner Lyrik angesehen und k&#246;nnen wohl zurecht als die bedeutendste Dichtung der Fr&#252;hromantik bezeichnet werden.\nDer Text besteht aus sechs Hymnen. Diese k&#246;nnen in drei Teile zu je zwei Hymnen gegliedert werden. In jedem dieser Teile kann das gleiche Grundmuster gefunden werden. Die jeweils ersten Hymnen beschreiben in einem f&#252;r Novalis typischen dreistufigen Modell die Entwicklung vom Leben im gl&#252;cklichen, irdischen Reich des Lichts &#252;ber eine Phase der schmerzhaften Entfremdung zur Befreiung in der ewigen Nacht. Die jeweils zweiten Hymnen schildern das ern&#252;chternde Aufwachen aus der Vision und die Sehnsucht nach der R&#252;ckkehr zu dieser Vision. Die drei Zyklen sind als Steigerung angelegt; in jeder dieser Stufen wird eine h&#246;here Ebene der Erfahrung und des Wissens erreicht. (Wikipedia)\n\n\nEnglish Description:\nIn August 1800, eight months after completion, the revised edition of the Hymnen an die Nacht was published in the Athenaeum. They are often considered to be the climax of Novalis&#8217; lyrical works and the most important poetry of the German early Romanticism.\nThe six hymns contain many elements which can be understood as autobiographical. Even though a lyrical &#8220;I&#8221;, rather than Novalis himself, is the speaker, there are many relationships between the hymns and Hardenberg&#8217;s experiences from 1797-1800.\nThe topic is the romantic interpretation of life and death, the threshold of which is symbolised by the night. Life and death are &#8211; according to Novalis &#8211; developed into entwined concepts. So in the end, death is the romantic principle of life.\nInfluences from the literature of that time can be seen. The metaphors of the hymns are closely connected to the books Novalis had read at about the time of his writing of the hymns. These are prominently Shakespeare&#8217;s Romeo and Juliet (in the translation by A.W.Schlegel, 1797) and Jean Paul&#8217;s Unsichtbare Loge (1793).\nThe Hymns to the Night display a universal religion with an intermediary. This concept is based on the idea that there is always a third party between a human and God. This intermediary can either be Jesus &#8211; as in Christian lore &#8211; or the dead beloved as in the hymns. These works consist of three times two hymns. These three components are each structured in this way: the first hymn shows, with the help of the Romantic triad, the development from an assumed happy life on earth through a painful era of alienation to salvation in the eternal night; the following hymn tells of the awakening from this vision and the longing for a return to it. With each pair of hymns, a higher level of experience and knowledge is shown. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

It was written in Classical Chinese rather than Vernacular Chinese. Pu is believed to have completed the majority of the tales sometime in 1679, though he could have added entries as late as 1707. He borrows from a folk tradition of oral storytelling to put to paper a series of captivating, colorful stories, where the boundary between reality and the odd or fantastic is blurred. The cast of characters includes vixen spirits, ghosts, scholars, court officials, Taoist exorcists and beasts. Moral purposes are often inverted between humans and the supposedly degenerate ghosts or spirits, resulting in a satirical edge to some of the stories. Ghosts and spirits are often bold and trustworthy, while humans are on the other hand weak, indecisive and easily manipulated, reflecting the author&#8217;s own disillusionment with his society.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

But without Reuben, a woman like Judith might have a bleak future in mid-19th century England: a loveless marriage or lifelong dependency are apparently her only options&#8230;\n\nA feminist, a Jew, and a lesbian, Amy Levy wrote about Anglo-Jewish cultural mores and the lives of would-be independent women in Victorian society. Levy was as repelled by contemporary literature&#8217;s occasional paragon (e.g., Daniel Deronda) as by its more frequent anti-Semitic stereotypes. REUBEN SACHS was her attempt at an honest, warts-and-all account of middle class Jewish life in late-19th century London. While many of Levy&#8217;s contemporaries condemned the book as a shanda fur die goyim (an embarrassment), Oscar Wilde wrote: &#8220;Its directness, its uncompromising truths, its depth of feeling, and above all, its absence of any single superfluous word, make REUBEN SACHS, in some sort, a classic.&#8221; Amy Levy (1861-1889) was born in London and educated in Brighton and at Newnham College, Cambridge. Her social set included Beatrix Potter and Eleanor Marx, with whom she studied in the British Museum Reading Room, and lover Vernon Lee (Violet Padget).\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

It follows on from his Critique of Pure Reason and deals with his moral philosophy. The second Critique exercised a decisive influence over the subsequent development of the field of ethics and moral philosophy, becoming the principle reference point for ethical systems that focus on the rightness or wrongness of actions themselves, as opposed to the rightness or wrongness of the consequences of those actions. Subsequently termed &#8220;deontological ethics&#8221;, Kant&#8217;s ethical system also laid the groundwork of moral absolutism, the belief that there are absolute standards against which moral questions can be judged, and that certain actions are right or wrong, devoid of the context of the act.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Although this angered Moore, as it was entirely unauthorized, she later accepted the edition as well made and used it as the basis for her own 1924 publication of Obersvations. Moore&#8217;s unique poetry matches the experimentation underway during the American Modernist movement. Much of it incorporates seemingly out-of-place quotations into complex free verse that often uses Nature as a subject matter.\n\nToday, despite the self-motivated alteration of her poetry in later life, done much to the dismay of her devotees, scholars consider Moore a significant American poet worthy of intense study in an a unalterable place in the canon.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
