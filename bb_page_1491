His father was an English immigrant, and his mother was born in Puerto Rico. He attended public school in Rutherford until 1897, then was sent to study at Ch&#226;teau de Lancy near Geneva, Switzerland, the Lyc&#233;e Condorcet in Paris, France, for two years and Horace Mann School in New York City. Then, in 1902, he entered the University of Pennsylvania Medical School. During his time at Penn, Williams befriended Ezra Pound, Hilda Doolittle (best known as H.D.) and the painter Charles Demuth. These friendships supported his growing passion for poetry. He received his M.D. in 1906 and spent the next four years in internships in New York City and in travel and postgraduate studies abroad (e.g., at the University of Leipzig where he studied pediatrics). He returned to Rutherford in 1910 and began his medical practice, which lasted until 1951. Ironically, most of his patients knew little if anything of his writings; instead they viewed him as a doctor who helped deliver over 2,000 of their children into the world. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

This work is among the first English novels. Like &#8216;Robinson Crusoe&#8217;, &#8216;Moll Flanders&#8217; and several other of his novels, Defoe published this work as though it were based on primary sources and was not, so he pretended, a novel at all. This was Defoe&#8217;s way of developing an audience among the reading public for fiction writing.\n\nThe work is remarkable in its abundant use of &#8220;telling detail&#8221; to create an impression of verisimilitude, and for nearly two hundred years it was widely considered a pioneering work of journalism rather than a novel. Indeed, it is still assigned as required reading in journalism courses\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
