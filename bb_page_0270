It is usually described as one of Tolstoy&#8217;s two major masterpieces (the other being Anna Karenina) as well as one of the world&#8217;s greatest novels.\n\n\nWar and Peace offered a new kind of fiction, with a great many characters caught up in a plot that covered nothing less than the grand subjects indicated by the title, combined with the equally large topics of youth, age and marriage. While today it is considered a novel, it broke so many novelistic conventions of its day that many critics of Tolstoy&#8217;s time did not consider it as such. Tolstoy himself considered Anna Karenina (1878) to be his first attempt at a novel in the European sense.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Hamilton gives a British person&#8217;s perspective on the 16th President of the United States. A glowing tribute to &#8220;Honest Abe&#8221;, the author traces Lincoln&#8217;s ancestral roots and recounts his birth in Kentucky, his youth in Indiana, his adult life in Illinois and his years in the White House. She also provides a good background on the causes and course of the American Civil War.\n\nHamilton is not always historically precise. For example, she erroneously names Jefferson Davis as the Southern Democratic candidate for president running against Lincoln and Douglas in 1860 rather than John C. Breckinridge. However, overall &#8220;The Story of Abraham Lincoln&#8221; is a good summarization and interesting account of the life, values and politics of Lincoln.\n\nCautions: Chapter 7 contains a single use of an epithet for African-Americans in a quotation from a British magazine. Chapter 8 ends with an example of a stereotypical Southern black dialect which many may find offensive.","shortDescription":"A biography of Abraham Lincoln by British writer","parentName":null,"discriminator":1,"categories":[{"name":"Childrens Books","parent":null,"id":141,"productTypeId":null,"nrOfResults":0}],"packageId":"gYABgO4U19OU0MfRw2wROXIfKpc","rating":-1,"ratingIntValue":-1,"minimumos":null,"vendorId":102,"iconId":1091856,"parentId":null,"vendorName":"S4BB Limited","contentAvailableAfterFiltering":null,"vendorHomeUrl":"http://www.s4bb.com","vendorSupportEmail":null,"vendorPrivacyPolicyURL":null,"screenShots":null,"_itemDetailsLink":"/content/18561089","nrOfReviews":0,"featuredDescription":"A biography of Abraham Lincoln by British writer","featuredIconId":1091857,"nrOfApprovedReviews":0,"rowNumber":null,"nameLength":40,"shortDescriptionLength":48,"orderColumn":null,"licenses":[{"initialRenewalPeriod":null,"licenseType":2,"price":4.99,"licenseModelType":1,"pricingtierId":4,"renewalPricintTierId":null,"renewalPrice":null,"accessDuration":null,"priceString":"$4.99","renewalPriceString":null,"purchaseAmountOfUnits":null,"purchaseUnitType":null}],"cdDTO":null,"iconImgUrl":"http://download.appworld.blackberry.com/ClientAPI/image/1091856","featuredIconImageUrl":"http://download.appworld.blackberry.com/ClientAPI/image/1091857","packageNameList":["audiobook18634f8d83b2c0e51ae6c53966eb4e79bc64"],"grandParentId":null,"grandParentName":null,"contentRatingLevel":1,"supportedCarriers":null,"supportedCountries":null},{"name":"z Bear Creek Collection Vol. 1 Audiobook","id":18561092,"description":"Breckinridge Elkins is the roughest, toughest, fastest-shootin&#8217;, hardest-fightin&#8217; feller in the Bear Creek settlement, and probably in the entire Humbolt Mountains. As he travels further from home, he single-handedly takes on outlaws, settles (and starts) feuds and tries his hand at romancing the girls. He also discovers a lot of strange customs among other folks, such as building houses out of boards and wearing clothes that ain&#8217;t buckskins.
