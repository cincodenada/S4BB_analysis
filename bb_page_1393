{"ldata":[{"name":"z The Way of All Flesh Audiobook","id":124860,"description":"The Way of All Flesh by Samuel Butler (Fiction, Literature, Satire)\n\nThe Way of All Flesh (1903) is a semi-autobiographical novel by Samuel Butler which attacks Victorian-era hypocrisy. Written between 1873 and 1884, it traces four generations of the Pontifex family. It represents the diminishment of religious outlook from a Calvinistic approach, which is presented as harsh. Butler dared not publish it during his lifetime, but when it was published it was accepted as part of the general revulsion against Victorianism.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

The very qualities that made him a menace in civilized society were valuable traits in a man who must successfully act the part of a merchant trader of the Beaker people during the Bronze Age.\n\nFor once they were transferred by time machine to the remote Baltic region where the Russian post was located, Ross and his partner Ashe were swept into a fantastic action-filled adventure involving Russians, superstitious prehistoric men, and the aliens of a lost galactic civilization that demanded every ounce of courage the Americans possessed.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Burgess\n\t\t\nThe Adventures of Reddy Fox is another in the series of children&#8217;s stories by conservationist Thornton W. Burgess. In this story, Reddy and Granny Fox must outsmart Farmer Brown&#8217;s Boy who is out to get Reddy for stealing his pet chicken. Along the way, Reddy encounters many of the citizens of the Green Meadows and the Green Forest and with him we learn little lessons about life such as: the perils of being a show off; the importance of using all of one&#8217;s senses; that it is a fine thing to show sympathy and kindness to others &#8211; even our enemies; and that the value of a grandmother&#8217;s wisdom is inestimable.\n\nWe also learn that after you&#8217;ve stolen a boy&#8217;s pet chicken and he is coming your way with a gun, a shovel and a hound dog, it may be time to beat a hasty retreat.\n\t\t\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
