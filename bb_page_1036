It is usually described as one of Tolstoy&#8217;s two major masterpieces (the other being Anna Karenina) as well as one of the world&#8217;s greatest novels.\n\nWar and Peace offered a new kind of fiction, with a great many characters caught up in a plot that covered nothing less than the grand subjects indicated by the title, combined with the equally large topics of youth, age and marriage. While today it is considered a novel, it broke so many novelistic conventions of its day that many critics of Tolstoy&#8217;s time did not consider it as such. Tolstoy himself considered Anna Karenina (1878) to be his first attempt at a novel in the European sense.\n\nNote: The novel is split up in 15 books. This is the recording of book two, which covers events in the year 1805.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

His slave-wife, though beautiful and smart, nags him constantly. He&#8217;s given up hope of ever returning to Earth when he hears of two astronauts who have been captured in a kingdom on the other side of the planet, and sets out on an action-packed journey on a ship sailing across vast grasslands on rolling pin-like wheels in a desperate scheme to save them and return home.

Law revolutionized the way in which 18th century Anglicans engaged the spiritual aspect of their faith, and his popularity rivaled that of John and Charles Wesley. Law adapted mystical practices from early church writings to the practice and doctrine of the modern British church, with the intention of equipping the Anglican layman to pursue intimacy with Christ.\n\nA Dialogue Between a Methodist and a Churchman is one of Law&#8217;s purely theological works. In it, Law engages what he sees as the most dangerous doctrines of Methodism using a dialectic format. The dialogue focuses especially on the Calvinistic doctrines of predestination and absolute depravity, and is remarkable for its extrapolation of Calvinist proof texts to refute the doctrines they allegedly prove.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Diderot was Enlightened. But trite titles seldom encompass completely the beliefs of any individual. And this one fact is certainly true when dealing with Sir Francis Bacon.\n\nThe youngest son of Sir Nicholas Bacon, Francis was born in Strand, London, on Jan. 22, 1561. He went to Trinity College at Cambridge. He was elected to Parliament; he was Queen&#8217;s Counsel; he even became Attorney General before finally gaining the position of Lord Chancellor.\n\n\nBut as do the careers of so many politicians, in 1621 his political career ended in disgrace.\n\n\nAnd yet, for all of this, both Diderot and Voltaire considered him &#8220;the father of modern science.&#8221; Others consider him only the father of the &#8220;scientific method.&#8221; (That process of collecting and organizing data.) Bacon&#8217;s &#8220;The Essays,&#8221; to which we now turn our attention, are&#8211;if they are nothing else&#8211;a delightful collection in decided disarray. That is, they seem to take no true progression. But an essay is not meant to be a treatise. And for all that, these essays are still a pleasure to read.\n\n\nEncompassing a broad field of interest, their largesse denotes the broad learning of this brilliant philosopher. It is therefore our sincere hope that the reader will, themselves, encompass these Essays. More importantly, we hope you enjoy them.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

As the play opens, King Henry IV (formerly Henry Bolingbroke) and Henry Percy (Hotspur) argue over the disposition of prisoners from the Battle of Holmedon. The King&#8217;s attitude toward Mortimer and the Percy family prompts them to plot rebellion. In the meantime, his son Prince Hal is living the low life in the company of Sir John Falstaff. As the time of battle nears, Prince Hal joins his father and is given a high command. The play&#8217;s climax is the Battle of Shrewsbury, in which Prince Hal and Hotspur meet and fight, with Prince Hal and the forces of the King prevailing. The action continues in King Henry IV, Part 2. From the start this has been an extremely popular play both with the public and with critics. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Inside the castle, she must cope with an unwanted suitor, Montoni&#8217;s threats, and the wild imaginings and terrors that threaten to overwhelm her.\n\nThe mysterious happenings in the story always have a natural and probable explanation because Radcliffe was a very rational person and did not believe in the supernatural. Radcliffe&#8217;s strengths in writing were in describing scenery as well as suspense and terror. Many critics have called the work &#8220;dreamlike&#8221; and &#8220;suggestive of the cinematic technique of slow-motion.&#8221;\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Under the rules of this society, &#8220;being things&#8221; is better than &#8220;doing things&#8221; and reputation and outward appearances come at the exclusion of everything else. In this Gilded Age, when America&#8217;s expansion and increased industrialism produce a group of newly wealthy robber barons and financiers, the patient, time-honored values of the old ruling class, and century, are giving way to the expediencies of the new. Caught at this cusp, a triangle of lovers, who must choose between the expectations of family and society, and the deepest yearnings of the heart.\nNewly engaged couple, Newland Archer, a young lawyer, and May Welland, a society debutante, are part of the old world, where the &#8220;right people&#8221; follow the &#8220;correct rules&#8221; and marry into &#8220;acceptable families.&#8221; The arrival from Europe of May&#8217;s cousin, the Countess Ellen Olenska, complicates their union, as Ellen&#8217;s mysterious past threatens to cast a shadow of scandal over the newly betrothed couple. Newland Archer, at first critical of Ellen&#8217;s bohemian lifestyle, and her seemingly wilful ignorance of the rules and customs of his Old New York, is soon captivated by Ellen&#8217;s warmth, spirit, and her generous and loving heart. Will he cast off the life for which he&#8217;s been groomed, or sacrifice happiness for duty and the greater good of the social order?\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
