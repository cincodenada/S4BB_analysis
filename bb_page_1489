M. Forster (Science fiction)\n\nThe Machine Stops is a short science fiction story. It describes a world in which almost all humans have lost the ability to live on the surface of the Earth. Each individual lives in isolation in a &#8216;cell&#8217;, with all bodily and spiritual needs met by the omnipotent, global Machine. Most humans welcome this development, as they are skeptical and fearful of first-hand experience. People forget that humans created the Machine, and treat it as a mystical entity whose needs supersede their own. Those who do not accept the deity of the Machine are viewed as &#8216;unmechanical&#8217; and are threatened with &#8220;Homelessness&#8221;. Eventually, the Machine apocalyptically collapses, and the civilization of the Machine comes to an end. (Wikipedia)\n\nComment by book coordinator:\nA condensed rapidfire of details and ideas imagining a dystopian world. Good thing he made it a short story. And the world he describes feels so appalling, although we are good on the way to be where Forster imagined us &#8211; shocker. So imaginative for 1909! Staying at home with the telly and internet and instant messaging and videoconferencing, google and pizza delivery and all flats and all cities look alike. And the loss of Patience! Damn this is good and so true &#8211; with one big exception the many buttons for all the machines functions. But how would Forster know of digital interfaces?

It was first published in 1906, and has since been republished many times. &#8211; In the book, Kakuzo introduces the term Teaism and how Tea has affected nearly every aspect of Japanese culture, thought, and life. The book is noted to be accessibile to Western audiences because though Kakuzo was born and raised Japanese, he was trained from a young age to speak English; and would speak it all his life, becoming proficient at communicating his thoughts in the Western Mind. In his book he elucidates such topics as Zen and Taoism, but also the secular aspects of Tea and Japanese life. The book emphasises how Teaism taught the Japanese many things; most importantly, simplicity. Kakuzo argues that this tea-induced simplicity affected art and architecture, and he was a long-time student of the visual arts. He ends the book with a chapter on Tea Masters, and spends some time talking about Sen no Rikyu and his contribution to the Japanese Tea Ceremony.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Rosamond Vincy&#8217;s finishing school education is a foil to Dorothea Brooke&#8217;s religiously-motivated quest for knowledge. Rosamond initially admires Lydgate for his exotic education, and his intellect. A similar dynamic is present in Dorothea and Casaubon&#8217;s relationship, with Dorothea revering her new husband&#8217;s intellect and eloquence. In both cases, however, the young wives&#8217; expectations of their husbands intellects are not reflected in reality.\n\nDespite extreme erudition, Mr. Casaubon is afraid to publish because he believes that he must write a work that is utterly above criticism. In contrast, Lydgate at times arrogantly flaunts his knowledge, making enemies with his fellow physicians. He regards the residents of Middlemarch with a certain amount of contempt stemming from his belief that the townspeople are backwards and uninteresting. However, his education has not included tact and politicking, skills necessary in a small town but are seen by Lydgate as below him, the brilliant doctor.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Hoffmann (Horror/Ghost stories, Mystery) (German)\n\nDer Bruder Medardus ist ein hoch angesehenes, f&#252;r seine feurigen Predigten bekanntes Mitglied der Klostergemeinde. Als ihm die Aufsicht &#252;ber die Reliquienkammer &#252;bertragen wird, beginnt jedoch sein Niedergang. Unter den Sch&#228;tzen befindet sich auch eine Flasche der Elixiere des Teufels, mit denen der Satan vor Jahrhunderten den heiligen Antonius verf&#252;hren wollte. Ein Schluck aus der Flasche besiegelt seinen Abstieg. Obgleich seine Predigten feuriger denn je werden, verliert er sich in Selbstverliebtheit und entsagt so dem G&#246;ttlichen.\n\nIn der Hoffnung, Medardus&#8217; Seele zu retten schickt ihn der Prior des Klosters auf die Reise nach Rom. Einmal frei von den Mauern des Klosters, beginnt Medardus Kampf gegen den den Verf&#252;hrer. Seine Reise ist gegpr&#228;gt von L&#252;gen, Diebstahl und Mord. Immer wieder begegnet er Personen, die ihm erstaunlich &#228;hnlich sind. In diesen findet er all seine Schw&#228;chen wieder, er schl&#252;pft in ihre Rollen, versucht ihr Leben und findet letztlich doch wieder zu sich selbst zur&#252;ck.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
