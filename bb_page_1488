Andreas Schou&apos;s Press, the 1883rd\n\nIf you have to put into words what science is about geography, it is to describe and analyze the earth&apos;s surface, its landscapes, people and wildlife - to delve into its soil and to study how the wind blows. For only a half century ago were mighty territory in Central Africa virtually unknown to Europeans. Heralded by sporadic sources that the vast continent saved to mysterious lands, lush sprawling forests, endless savannahs and lakes as large as the garden. But it was extremely difficult to explore the continent and very risky for those who tried. Many died of disease and exhaustion in the impenetrable jungle wilderness, others thirsted to death in the deserts and again others were murdered in bestial ways by hostile natives.\n\nThe indomitable English globetrotter dr. Samuel Fergusson set out to implement the risky experiment to explore Africa from east to west through his balloon, accompanied by his close friend Scotsman Dick Kennedy and the faithful servant Joe. The novel contains not only the three fictional heroes unique process of the unknown country, but also gives an insight into the many authentic expeditions, which was then attempted in Central Africa, not infrequently with a tragic final.\n\nMuch has changed in our knowledge on the continent and not least our view of the African peoples have been considerably more nuanced since Jules Verne wrote the novel in 1863. Nevertheless, the novel is an interesting and rare photo of a native African, from before the time when Europeans really left its mark on the culture and landscape.\n\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

The renowned Victorian poet Elizabeth Barrett wrote the sonnet sequence during her courtship by Robert Browning, and later presented them to him as a wedding gift. Robert was astounded by the quality of the poetry, and encouraged her to publish, but Elizabeth objected on the grounds that the content was too personal. At last, Robert prevailed, and Elizabeth published her sonnets. The title of the book comes from a joke between Robert and Elizabeth Browning. Elizabeth was too embarrassed to publish the sonnets as a personal chronicle, so she decided to pretend they were a translation from a foreign language. Robert&#8217;s nickname for her was &#8220;My Little Portuguese&#8221; due to her dark hair and olive complexion, and so the sequence was forever known as &#8220;Sonnets from the Portuguese.&#8221; \n\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

At age 19, and living under her uncle Fulbert&#8217;s roof, Heloise fell in love with Abelard, who she was studying under. Not only did they have a clandestine affair of a sexual nature, they had a child, Astrolabe, out of wedlock. Discovered by the Fulbert (who was a Church official), Abelard was assaulted by a hired thug and castrated, and Heloise entered a convent. Abelard was exiled to Brittany, where he lived as monk. Eventually Heloise became abbess of the Oratory of the Paraclete, an abbey which Abelard had founded.\n\nIt was at this time that they exchanged their famous letters, presented in this book. The letters, originally written in Latin, are passionate both in the remembrance of lost love, and the attempt to reconcile that love with their respective monastic duty to remain chaste. The tension between these two poles generates a huge amount of emotional electricity. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

It offered a modernist approach, discussing religion dispassionately as a cultural phenomenon, rather than from a theological perspective. Although most of its theories have subsequently been exploded (the most famous one being that of the relationship between magic, religion and science), its impact on contemporaneous European literature was substantial.\n\nThe Golden Bough attempts to define the shared elements of religious belief, ranging from ancient belief systems to relatively modern religions such as Christianity. Its thesis is that old religions were fertility cults that centered around the worship of, and periodic sacrifice of, a sacred king. This king was the incarnation of a dying and reviving god, a solar deity who underwent a mystic marriage to a goddess of the earth, who died at the harvest, and was reincarnated in the spring. Frazer claims that this legend is central to almost all of the world&#8217;s mythologies, and he offers a plethora of colourful examples from all over the world. Moreover, his book is written in an admirable style, seldom excelled by his more modern colleagues.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Anthony, her best friend for over 50 years. While Elizabeth initially stayed home with her husband and many babies and wrote the speeches, Susan went on the road to bring the message of the women&#8217;s rights movement to an often hostile public. When black men were given the vote in 1870, Susan and Elizabeth led the women&#8217;s rights establishment of the time to withhold support for a bill that would extend to black men the rights still denied for women of all colors. The two women worked for over 50 years on the women&#8217;s rights cause, yet neither lived to see women get the right to vote when it finally came in 1920.\nElizabeth begins her memoirs with this quotation, &#8220;Social science affirms that woman&#8217;s place in society marks the level of civilization.&#8221; She dedicates this book to &#8220;SUSAN B.

Its total sales in both America and Europe reached 500,000 copies. It convinced many colonists, including George Washington and John Adams, to seek redress in political independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain, and argued strongly against any compromise short of independence.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

A slave takes on the identity of master and heir while the rightful heir is condemned to live the life of a slave. Twain uses this vehicle to explore themes of nature vs. nurture, racial bigotry and moral relativism. The case of mistaken identity is a theme that Twain explored also in THE PRINCE AND THE PAUPER; in THE TRAGEDY OF PUDD&#8217;NHEAD WILSON he turns the theme into a well-crafted detective story. It is unfortunate that this is one of Twain&#8217;s lesser known works as it is one of his most enjoyable reads.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
