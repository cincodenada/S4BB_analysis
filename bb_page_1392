{"ldata":[{"name":"z The Ego and His Own Audiobook","id":124821,"description":"The Ego and His Own by Max Stirner (Philosophy)\n\nIn this book, his most famous, Max Stirner presents a philosophical case for a radical egoism that shuns the socially-oriented outlooks of both &quot;establishment&quot; ideologies and of revolutionaries in favor of an extreme individualism. The book is most widely talked about today only through the lens of other philosophers&apos; thought: Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels launched a famous assault on it in The German Ideology, and some draw a connection between Stirner&apos;s thoughts here and Nietzsche&apos;s egoism a generation later. But it is worth reading in its own right, as much for its lyricism as the challenge of its philosophical proposals.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

The novel spans a period of 10-15 years, from Tom and Maggie&#8217;s childhood up until their deaths in a flood on the Floss. The book is fictional autobiography in part, reflecting the disgrace that George Eliot (Mary Ann Evans) herself had while in a lengthy relationship with a married man, George Henry Lewes.\nMaggie Tulliver holds the central role in the book, as both her relationship with her older brother Tom, and her romantic relationships with Philip Wakem, a hunchbacked, but sensitive and intellectual, friend, and with Stephen Guest, a vivacious young socialite in St. Oggs and fiance of Maggie&#8217;s cousin Lucy Deane, constitute the most significant narrative threads: \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Stillwell felt a duty &#8220;to help save the Nation;&#8221; but, as with many other young men, his Patriotism was tinged with bravura: &#8220;the idea of staying at home and turning over senseless clods on the farm with the cannon thundering so close at hand . . . was simply intolerable.&#8221; Stillwell volunteered for the 61st Illinois Infantry in January 1861. His youthful enthusiasm for the soldier&#8217;s life was soon tempered at Shiloh, where he first &#8220;saw a gun fired in anger,&#8221; and &#8220;saw a man die a violent death.&#8221;\n\nStillwell&#8217;s recounting of events is always vivid, personal, and engrossing. &#8220;I distinctly remember my first shot at Shiloh . . . The fronts of both lines were . . . shrouded in smoke. I had my gun at a ready, and was trying to peer under the smoke in order to get a sight of our enemies. Suddenly I heard someone in a highly excited tone calling to me from just in my rear, &#8211;&#8217;Stillwell! Shoot! Shoot! Why don&#8217;t you shoot?&#8217; I looked around and saw that this command was being given by . . . our second lieutenant, who was wild with excitement, jumping up and down like a hen on a hot griddle. &#8216;Why, lieutenant,&#8217; I said, &#8216;I can&#8217;t see anything to shoot at.&#8217; &#8216;Shoot, shoot, anyhow!&#8217; &#8216;All right,&#8217; I responded. . . And bringing my gun to my shoulder, I aimed low in the direction of the enemy, and blazed away through the smoke. But at the time the idea to me was ridiculous that one should blindly shoot into a cloud of smoke without having a bead on the object to be shot at.&#8221;\n\nThe Story of a Common Soldier is a compelling coming of age tale that will appeal not only to Civil War buffs but to anyone who enjoys autobiographies. Written at the urging of his youngest son, when Stillwell was a mature man&#8211;a lawyer, judge, and member of the Kansas legislature, it combines graphic detail (provided by his war diary and letters written at the time to his family) with the insights of a thoughtful man looking back on those horrific times.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Published in three parts in 1794, 1795, and 1807, it was a bestseller in America, where it caused a short-lived deistic revival. British audiences, however, fearing increased political radicalism as a result of the French revolution, received it with more hostility.\n\nThe Age of Reason presents common deistic arguments. For example, it highlights the corruption of the Christian Church and criticizes its efforts to acquire political power. Paine advocates reason in the place of revelation, leading him to reject miracles and to view the Bible as an ordinary piece of literature rather than as a divinely-inspired text. Yet, The Age of Reason is not atheistic: it promotes natural religion and argues for a creator-God.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
