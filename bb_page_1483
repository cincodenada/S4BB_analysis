The music of Beethoven and Mozart, of Mendelssohn and Schumann may perish, but so long as mothers sing their babies to sleep the melody of cradle lullabies will remain. Of all English and American writers the one who sang most often and most exquisitely these cradle songs was Eugene Field, the children&#8217;s poet. His verses not only have charm as poetry, but a distinct song quality and a naive fancy that is both childlike and appealing. That they were written out of Eugene Field&#8217;s deep and genuine love of children and out of his sympathetic understanding of their wondering minds is evident from the fact that his lullabies have taken a high and what seems to be a permanent place in the world&#8217;s classic literature of childhood. (Excerpted by Becky Miller from the Introduction by Edwin Osgood Grover to &#8220;Cradle Lullabies&#8221; by Eugene Field, published in 1909)\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

The story concerns Paul Dombey, the wealthy owner of the shipping company of the book&#8217;s title, whose dream is to have a son to continue his business. The book begins when his son is born, and Dombey&#8217;s wife dies shortly after giving birth.\n\nAs with most of Dickens&#8217; work, a number of socially significant themes are to be found in this book. In particular the book deals with the then-prevalent common practice of arranged marriages for financial gain. Other themes to be detected within this work include child cruelty (particularly in Dombey&#8217;s treatment of Florence), familial relationships, and as ever in Dickens, betrayal and deceit and the consequences thereof. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

It was serialized posthumously in Harper&#8217;s Weekly, and published in book form by Harper and Brothers of New York City in 1888. This satirical romance is the story of Adam More, a British sailor. Shipwrecked in Antarctica, he stumbles upon a tropical lost world of prehistoric animals, plants, and a cult of death-worshipping primitives. He also finds a highly developed human society which has reversed the values of Victorian society. Wealth is scorned and poverty revered; death and darkness are preferrable to life and light. Rather than accumulating wealth, the natives seek to divest themselves of it as quickly as possible. At the beginning of each year, the government imposes wealth (the burden of &#8220;reverse taxation&#8221;) upon its unfortunate subjects as a form of punishment. A secondary plot about the four yachtsmen who find the manuscript forms a frame for the central narrative.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Whether or not Yang Chu was actually a native of the Wei State, or whether he came there drawn by the attraction of a critical and unrivalled audience, it is at least certain that he settled there as small proprietor, probably in the reign of King Hwei, and continued there till his death, about 250 B.C.\n\nOne may imagine a condition of life in many respects somewhat analogous to the life of Epicurus in his famous Athenian Garden. To the philosopher of pleasure and contentment came pupils and disciples, discourses were held in much the same way as at an identical period discourses were held in the garden at Athens, and it is to these discourses, memorised and recorded by his favourite pupil Meng-sun-Yang, that we most probably owe the single fragment of the teaching of Yang Chu that remains, a fragment complete and explicit enough to enable us to form a clear estimate of his teaching and philosophy.\n\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Richardson trans.), On the Old Saw (E.B. Ashton trans.), or On the Common Saying (both M.J. Gregor and H.B. Nisbet), Kant takes up the issue of the relation of theory to practice in three distinct ways. In the first, he replies to Christian Garve&#8217;s criticism of his moral theory, in the second, he distances himself from Thomas Hobbes, and in the third, Moses Mendelssohn. The three taken together are representative of the breadth of Kant&#8217;s moral and political thought; the first section being concerned with the individual, the second with the state, and the third with the species. Although this is, on the whole, a difficult piece to approach, the second and third sections are often read as a way into Kant&#8217;s political thought, and serve this purpose well, especially when read alongside his Perpetual Peace. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Kant puts forth necessary means to any peace, and argues that nations can be brought into federation with one another without loss of sovereignty. In one translation, telling of the historical impact of this essay, this federation is called a &#8220;league of nations.&#8221; The supplements and appendices are of considerable interest on their own. The supplements contain an argument regarding the use which nature makes of war, and the way in which nature, in the end, impels us towards peace. The appendices return to the question of whether his theory is mere theory, or whether it bears translation into practice. In this, he distinguishes between the moral politician and the political moralist, pointing out ways in which practical considerations conceal and excuse behavior that leads us towards discord and war. This essay continues to be relevant, and of great importance today, much to our shame. We hope still to find the perpetual peace which Kant argued as a obligatory goal, and we still have need of fear that we will, as Kant warned, &#8220;find Perpetual Peace only in the wide grave which is to cover all the abomination of the deeds of violence and their authors.&#8221;\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

A hero to some, a dastardly villain to others, this book is structured round a year in his life. Starting with William waking up on Christmas morning and ending with him going to sleep the following Christmas Eve, there are the usual round of misadventures, misunderstandings, and general mayhem in between. When a boy like William wakes up under a motto that says &#8220;A Busy Day Is A Happy Day&#8221; alongside a copy of &#8220;Things A Boy Can Do&#8221;, chaos is just around the corner. Includes the very first William short story &#8211; &#8220;Rice Mould&#8221;. Often dismissed as children&#8217;s literature, the first few books of William stories were probably aimed more at an adult audience. They resonate with a distinctly English humour, but there are obvious echoes from &#8216;Tom Sawyer&#8217; and &#8216;Huckleberry Finn&#8217;. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
