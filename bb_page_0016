He is regarded as a major &#8220;innovator in the art of the short story&#8221;; his children&#8217;s books are enduring classics of children&#8217;s literature; and his best work speaks to a versatile and luminous narrative gift.\n\nDan and Una met Puck last summer, in Puck of Pook&#8217;s Hill. This summer, they meet him again &#8211; and several individuals from different periods in history, who, while generally not famous themselves, tell their tales of meeting Queen Elizabeth, Francis Drake, George Washington, and other well-known historical figures. Sadly, Dan and Una forget these encounters as soon as they are over, but the reader can enjoy them for years to come!\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
