Rider Haggard ( Adventure )\n\nAllan Quatermain was the quintessential Victorian English gentleman cum African big-game hunter. In this book, the second in the series, Quaterman and his two good friends from KSM have tired of their dull and unfulfilling lives in England, and decide to search for the truth of an old tale about the existence of an isolated white kingdom deep in darkest Africa. Their journey and subsequent adventures are sure to satisfy those who enjoy tales of dangerous quests and heroic just-in-time derring-do.\n\nAllan Quatermain appears in some 15 to 18 stories or books by H. Rider Haggard. (The number varies by source and apparently depends on how one chooses to count the shorter stories.) Haggard suggests that Quatermain was the author of the works, and he (Haggard) only edited and published them. The most famous Quatermain book is the first, King Solomon&#8217;s Mines (1885), and the sequel (1887) was Allan Quatermain &#8211; in which the main character, shall we say, departs for a better place! All the other Quatermain books &#8211; even those whose events occurred earlier in time &#8211; seem to have been written after these two main titles.\n\nThe internal chronology of Quatermain&#8217;s life is a big mess, to be honest. As you study the research and learn of the numerous contradictions of timing of events in the books, you see that conjecture and invention are required to create any kind of internal chronology that makes sense. So my advice is to read (listen to) the books for enjoyment, don&#8217;t take notes!, and don&#8217;t worry about how one event simply can&#8217;t be possible on the apparent date because it conflicts wtih some other event in a different story! Hey! It&#8217;s fiction &#8211; anything goes!

It is the story of a spirited young American woman, Isabel Archer, who &#8220;affronts her destiny&#8221; and finds it overwhelming. She inherits a large amount of money and subsequently becomes the victim of Machiavellian scheming by two American expatriates. Like many of James&#8217;s novels, it is set mostly in Europe, notably England and Italy.\n\nGenerally regarded as the masterpiece of his early phase of writing, this novel reflects James&#8217;s absorbing interest in the differences between the New World and the Old. It also treats in a profound way the themes of personal freedom, responsibility, betrayal, and sexuality.

In it, Aristotle explores the role that the political community should play in developing the virtue of its citizens. One of his central ideas is that &#8220;Man is a political animal,&#8221; meaning that people can only become virtuous by active participation in the political community. Aristotle also criticizes his teacher Plato, classifies and evaluates six different types of constitutions and political institutions, and describes his vision of the ideal state.
