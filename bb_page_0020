He originally planned to have his memoirs published only after his death but realized, once he&#8217;d passed his 70th year, that a lot of the material might be OK to publish before his departure. These chapters were published in serial form in the North American Review during 1906-1907. While much of the material consists of stories about the people, places and incidents of his long life, there&#8217;re also several sections from his daughter, which he calls &#8220;Susy&#8217;s biography of me&#8221;.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
