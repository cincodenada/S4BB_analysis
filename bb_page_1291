The story first appeared, anonymously, in Putnam&#8217;s Magazine in two parts. The first part appeared in November 1853, with the conclusion published in December 1853. It was reprinted in Melville&#8217;s The Piazza Tales in 1856 with minor textual alterations. The work is said to have been inspired, in part, by Melville&#8217;s reading of Emerson, and some have pointed to specific parallels to Emerson&#8217;s essay, &#8220;The Transcendentalist.&#8221; \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

This does not appear to be the conventional Hell described by Dante in The Inferno, but rather the Hades described in Greek myth (both of which had Styxes): a universal collecting pot for dead souls, regardless of their deeds in life.\n\nThe book begins with Charon, ferryman of the Styx (in The Inferno, he was the ferryman of the river Acheron) being startled&#8212;and annoyed&#8212;by the arrival of a house boat on the Styx. At first afraid that the boat will put him out of business, he later finds out that he is actually to be appointed the boat&#8217;s janitor.\n\nWhat follows are eleven more stories (for a total of twelve) which are set on the house boat. There is no central theme, and the purpose of the book appears to be as a literary thought experiment to see what would happen if various famous dead people were put in the same room with each other. Each chapter is a short story featuring various souls from history and mythology.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

He was born on November 28, 1873, in Kovno, Lithuania; he died on November 11, 1953, in New York City. Ginzberg taught at the Jewish Theological seminary from 1903 to 1953. For 50 years, he trained two generations of Conservative Rabbis.\n\nThe Legends of the Jews is an epic 7-volume compilation of traditional Jewish stories loosely related to the Bible. Volumes 1-4 contain the stories, while volumes 5-7 contain Ginzberg&#8217;s notes and commentary. Over the millenia, these stories, which expand on the Bible, flesh out the lives of biblical figures. In the process, they help bring to life the Bible&#8217;s valuable lessons.\n\nThe Legends of the Jews has been called a monumental work of scholarship. It is studied by serious students of both Judaism and Christianity. And yet the stories continue to be accessible and understood by all. They were designed to impart lessons of the Torah, and any child or adult will find much to enjoy about this work.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

It is a story of religious and metaphysical orthodoxy, both of which Voltaire challenges with his presentation of the moral revolution taking place in Zadig himself.

It is usually described as one of Tolstoy&#8217;s two major masterpieces (the other being Anna Karenina) as well as one of the world&#8217;s greatest novels.\n\nWar and Peace offered a new kind of fiction, with a great many characters caught up in a plot that covered nothing less than the grand subjects indicated by the title, combined with the equally large topics of youth, age and marriage. While today it is considered a novel, it broke so many novelistic conventions of its day that many critics of Tolstoy&#8217;s time did not consider it as such. Tolstoy himself considered Anna Karenina (1878) to be his first attempt at a novel in the European sense. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

M&#229;ske kr&#230;ver dette hverken mirakler, opstandelse eller genf&#248;dsel, men blot at man beslutter at g&#248;re det &#8211; at man beslutter sig for at g&#229; tilbage til hvor den svundne tid to sin begyndelse og starter forfra. Det er i hvert fald hvad romanens hovedperson Niels Faber s&#230;tter sig for. Million&#230;rens Pilegrimsf&#230;rd er en roman, der til trods for at den blev skrevet for mere end hundrede &#229;r siden, stadig er aktuel for ethvert menneske som p&#229; et tidspunkt i tilv&#230;relsen har skuet tilbage og t&#230;nkt den tanke at livet kunne have formet sig anderledes. Romanen er forfatterens sidste. Otto M. M&#248;ller d&#248;de i en alder af otteogtredive &#229;r. Forfatteren skrev den mens han var d&#248;ende og han havde formentlig en forudanelse af hvad der ventede ham. M&#229;ske derfor rummer dele af fort&#230;llingen nogen bitterhed. Romanen rummer dog ogs&#229; en hyldest til verdens sk&#248;nhed, den dejlige natur og til det &#230;rlige j&#230;vne menneske. I dag, i det enogtyvende &#229;rhundrede, kan vi derudover gl&#230;de os over at bogen giver et sj&#230;ldent godt &#248;jebliksbillede af det almindelige menneskes hverdagsliv i Danmark omkring 1890&#8242;erne. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
