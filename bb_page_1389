However, during his life he was more famous for many more realistic novels. . . among them the somewhat autobiographical Ranald Bannerman&#8217;s Boyhood.\n\nThis story of a young motherless boy growing up with his brothers in a Scottish manse is full of delightful characters. There is Kirsty, an enchanting Highland storyteller, Turkey, the intrepid cowherd, the evil Kelpie, and the lovely Elsie Duff. Throughout the twists and turns of his escapades and adventures Ranald learns from his father the important lessons of courage and integrity.\n\nWhen Ranald Bannerman&#8217;s Boyhood came out in 1871 the New York Independent praised it as &#8220;full of sweetness, full of boy-life and true goodness&#8221;. Perhaps, but it is also a good story, from the master of storytellers.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

It has been described as the single most important and influential work in the West in medieval and early Renaissance Christianity, and is also the last great work that can be called Classical.\n\nConsolation of Philosophy was written during Boethius&#8217; one year imprisonment while awaiting trial, and eventual horrific execution, for the crime of treason by Ostrogothic King Theodoric the Great. Boethius was at the very heights of power in Rome and was brought down by treachery. It was from this experience he was inspired to write a philosophical book from prison reflecting on how a lord&#8217;s favor could change so quickly and why friends would turn against him. It has been described as &#8216;by far the most interesting example of prison literature the world has ever seen.&#8217;\n\nThe Consolation of Philosophy stands, by its note of fatalism and its affinities with the Christian doctrine of humility, midway between the heathen philosophy of Seneca the Younger and the later Christian philosophy of consolation represented by Thomas Aquinas. &#8211; The book is heavily influenced by Plato and his dialogues (as was Boethius himself).\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

He studied medicine at the University of London and pursued a career as a surgeon in Scotland. He became professor of Surgery in Glasgow and later (1877) at Kings College Hospital, in London.\n\nLister&#8217;s contribution to the advancement of surgery cannot be overestimated. Before his work on antisepsis, wounds were often left open to heal, leading to long recoveries, unsightly scarring, and not infrequently amputation or death due to infection. Lister&#8217;s work enabled more wounds to be closed primarily with sutures, drastically reducing healing time, scarring, amputations, and deaths due to infection.\n\nLister retired in 1896 but was called back to assist in the operation on King Edward VII for appendicitis just days before the King&#8217;s coronation. The King later credited Lister for his survival and quick recovery. Lister died in 1912. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

It is to this fact, that any little history there is of the Norse Kings and their old tragedies, crimes and heroisms, is almost all due. The Icelanders, it seems, not only made beautiful letters on their paper or parchment, but were laudably observant and desirous of accuracy; and have left us such a collection of narratives (Sagas, literally &#8220;Says&#8221;) as, for quantity and quality, is unexampled among rude nations. Snorro Sturleson&#8217;s History of the Norse Kings is built out of these old Sagas; and has in it a great deal of poetic fire,. . . and deserves to be reckoned among the great history-books of the world. It is from these sources that the following rough notes of the early Norway Kings are hastily thrown together.&#8221;\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
