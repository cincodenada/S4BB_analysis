It is widely held to be one of Dickens&#8217; finest and most complete novels, containing one of the most vast, complex and engaging arrays of minor characters and sub-plots in his entire canon. Dickens tells all of these both through the narrative of the novel&#8217;s heroine, Esther Summerson, and as an omniscient narrator. Memorable characters include the menacing lawyer Tulkinghorn, the friendly but depressive John Jarndyce and the childish Harold Skimpole. The plot concerns a long-running legal dispute (Jarndyce and Jarndyce) which has far-reaching consequences for all involved.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Gogol himself saw it as an &#8220;epic poem in prose&#8221;, and within the book as a &#8220;novel in verse&#8221;. Despite supposedly completing the trilogy&#8217;s second part, Gogol destroyed it shortly before his death. Although the novel ends in mid-sentence (like Sterne&#8217;s Sentimental Journey), it is usually regarded as complete in the extant form.\n\nIn Russia before the emancipation of the serfs in 1861, landowners were entitled to own serfs to farm their land. Serfs were for most purposes considered the property of the landowner, and could be bought, sold, or mortgaged against, as any other chattel. To count serfs (and people in general), the measure word &#8220;soul&#8221; was used: e.g., &#8220;six souls of serfs&#8221;. The plot of the novel relies on &#8220;dead souls&#8221; (i.e., &#8220;dead serfs&#8221;) which are still accounted for in property registers. On another level, the title refers to the &#8220;dead souls&#8221; of Gogol&#8217;s characters, all of which visualise different aspects of poshlost (an untranslatable Russian word which is perhaps best rendered as &#8220;self-satisfied inferiority&#8221;, moral and spiritual, with overtones of middle-class pretentiousness, fake significance, and philistinism). \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

November 8, 1342 &#8211; c. 1416) is considered to be one of the greatest English mystics. Little is known of her life aside from her writings. Even her name is uncertain, the name &#8220;Julian&#8221; coming from the Church of St Julian in Norwich, where she occupied a cell adjoining the church as an anchoress.\n\nAt the age of thirty, suffering from a severe illness and believing she was on her deathbed, Julian had a series of intense visions. (They ended by the time she overcame her illness on May 13, 1373). These visions would twenty years later be the source of her major work, called Sixteen Revelations of Divine Love (circa 1393). This is believed to be the first book written by a woman in the English language. Julian became well known throughout England as a spiritual authority.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
