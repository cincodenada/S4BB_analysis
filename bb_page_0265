It is usually described as one of Tolstoy&#8217;s two major masterpieces (the other being Anna Karenina) as well as one of the world&#8217;s greatest novels.\n\nWar and Peace offered a new kind of fiction, with a great many characters caught up in a plot that covered nothing less than the grand subjects indicated by the title, combined with the equally large topics of youth, age and marriage. While today it is considered a novel, it broke so many novelistic conventions of its day that many critics of Tolstoy&#8217;s time did not consider it as such. Tolstoy himself considered Anna Karenina (1878) to be his first attempt at a novel in the European sense. \n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Housman (Poetry)\n\nA Shropshire Lad is a cycle of sixty-three poems by the English poet Alfred Edward Housman. A Shropshire Lad was first published in 1896 at Housman&#8217;s own expense after several publishers had turned it down. At first the book sold slowly, but during the Second Boer War, Housman&#8217;s nostalgic depiction of rural life and young men&#8217;s early deaths struck a chord with English readers and the book became a bestseller. Later, World War I further increased its popularity.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
