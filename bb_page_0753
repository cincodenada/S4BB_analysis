And very large-sized dogs shall romp through every page! And the mercury shiver perpetually in the vicinity of zero! And every foot of earth be crusty-brown and bare with no white snow at all till the very last moment when you&#8217;d just about given up hope! And all the heart of the story is very,&#8212;oh very young!\n\n\nFor purposes of propriety and general historical authenticity there are of course parents in the story. And one or two other oldish persons. But they all go away just as early in the narrative as I can manage it.&#8212;Are obliged to go away!\n\nYet lest you find in this general combination of circumstances some sinister threat of audacity, let me conventionalize the story at once by opening it at that most conventional of all conventional Christmas-story hours,&#8212;the Twilight of Christmas Eve.&#8221; (excerpt from the text)\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

It is a tale written for children that adults also find interesting and uplifting. Dodge writes as if she is sending a series of letters from Holland to children in America, and her you-are-there perspective is aided by a nice attention to detail and vivid imagery.\n\nThe Brinkers are a poor but stoic family under a dark cloud &#8211; Raff, the man of the house, fell from the dikes while reinforcing them during a bad storm, and for ten years he has been in a vegetative state. With no steady income, the family&#8217;s lot is grinding poverty. Despite their unfortunate circumstances, Hans and Gretel are cheerful children, yet always attentive to the needs of their mother and their present-but-not-really-there father. Their social standing is very low, but they both attract firm friends, even among the gentry, for their honesty, industry, and good-heartedness.\n\nThen a glorious skating race is proposed for the town of Broek, with the prize a pair of silver skates for both the winning boy and girl. In the weeks leading up to the race, we follow the adventures of five of the local boys who are showing a visiting relative from England the sights of the Netherlands. Hans improbably meets the one man who might be able to heal his father, and somehow Hans finds a way to afford some skates so that he and Gretel can enter the race.\n\nThis all leads up to a dramatic, moving, and entirely satisfactory conclusion. &#8220;Hans Brinker&#8221; hits a series of high notes and encourages children to cultivate and display their finer qualities.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.

Book 3 begins with a wealth of biblical scholarship, directed at establishing the authority of Scripture while at the same time undermining modern claims to supernatural revelation that would subvert civil law. Hobbes concludes that we cannot be sure of anyone else&#8217;s divine revelation, and that religious authority is therefore subordinate to civil power. Book 4, titled &#8220;Of the Kingdom of Darkness,&#8221; sets forth the various ways in which Scripture has been misinterpreted by the church, according to Hobbes, in mixing pagan elements with Christianity.\n\nAll audio content of this audiobook is contained in the app. There is no need for an internet connection after the app has been installed.
